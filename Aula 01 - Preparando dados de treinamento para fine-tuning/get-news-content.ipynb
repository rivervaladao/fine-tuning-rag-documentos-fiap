            "At least 57 people have been killed and a further 373 are missing as heavy rain andfloodinghit the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul this week. At least 74 others have been injured amid the series of catastrophic floods that has affected 281 municipalities, according to the latest figures shared by the civil defense Saturday. The local government has declared a state of calamity in areas where more than 67,000 people are impacted. Almost 10,000 have been displaced and more than 4,500 are in temporary shelters, the civil defense said. Authorities are closely monitoring dams that are not designed to handle such a high volume of water but said there is no imminent risk of failure. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met with local officials overseeing the relief efforts Thursday. “We are witnessing a historic disaster, unfortunately,” said the state’s governor, Eduardo Leite. “The material losses are gigantic, but our focus at this moment is rescues. There are still people waiting for help.” Images showed muddy brown waters rising as high as rooftops in some areas, while rescue teams were out with inflatable rafts, taking people and pets on board. On Saturday morning, the water level in the Guaíba Lake grew five meters due to intense rains, threatening the state’s capital Porto Alegre, authorities said. Rio Grande do Sul has been increasingly hit by extreme weather events in recent years. At least 54 people died in the state in September after it endured a sub-tropical cyclone. This year’s death toll has already surpassed that record. The climate crisis, caused primarily by humans burning fossil fuels, is supercharging extreme weather around the world, making many eventsmore intenseand more frequent. In the past few weeks alone, record rainfall has triggered deadly floods and brought chaos to the desert city of Dubai; reservoirs across Southeast Asia have been drying up in a persistent regional heatwave and ongoing drought, while Kenya is battling floods and heavy rainfall that has burst river banks and killed nearly 200 people. Last year was the hottest on record, with air and ocean temperatures climbing beyond many scientists’ predictions. The world is already 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in pre-industrial times. The proportion of high-intensity hurricanes, or tropical cyclones,has increaseddue to the warmer global temperatures, according to the UN. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and are lasting longer. Scientists have also found that the storms are more likely to stall and lead to devastating rainfall and they last longer after making landfall.

            "At least 91 people are missing afterheavy floodingacross Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, the government said Tuesday, after weeks of heavy rain and flash floods ravaged parts of the country. Some 76 people are missing after flooding near the hard hit town of Mai Mahiu, northwest of Nairobi. Locals and first responders told CNN the disaster was caused by water blowing through a clogged tunnel under a railway bridge. So far, 71 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the incident. A further 10 people are missing in Kenya’s eastern region, four in Nairobi County and one in the coastal region, which borders the Indian Ocean, said Isaac Mwaura, a government spokesperson. The floods have also led to the displacement of 190,942 Kenyans, which Mwaura said is around 5,000 more people than on Monday. “Nairobi County is the worst hit with 147,000 fellow Kenyans being displaced and, therefore, it accounts for 77% of all the displacement in the country,” he said. A CNN team on the ground said in one area of Mai Mahiu a strong smell led villagers to believe a body lay under a pile of uprooted trees and mud. One resident, a motorbike taxi rider, who did not wish to be named, told CNN he had provided fuel for a power saw that was being used to cut down uprooted trees. “Ask the government to send us excavators,” he said. Kenyan President William Ruto has ordered the military to deploy personnel to help find missing people. The CNN team said a body of a young man was pulled out of the flood debris earlier on Tuesday in the same area after the ring of a mobile phone prompted neighbours to start digging. They say it took the residents hours of digging on Monday and Tuesday to be able to recover that body. Mwaura said the government has set up 52 “displacement camps” – an increase of two since Monday – to provide those affected by the flooding “with alternative temporary accommodation.” “The weather forecast from April 30 to May 6 indicates that rainfall is expected to continue over several parts of the country,” he said, which he warned ” threatens to exacerbate the ongoing floods.” The government is “providing food and non-food items and offering rescue and evacuation,” Mwaura also noted. Kenya has registered heavy rain since mid-March but downpours have intensified over the past week, leading to mass flooding which has killed dozens of people. “Kenya is facing a worsening flood crisis due to the combined effects of El Niño and the ongoing March-May 2024 long rains,” IFRC Secretary General and CEO Jagan Chapagainsaid in a post on X, referring to the climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world. “Since November 2023, El Niño triggered devastating floods and river overflows, causing more than a hundred deaths and widespread damage.” The Horn of Africa, a region of East Africa that includes Kenya, is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. Heavy rains have also affected Tanzania and Burundi. The impact of Kenya’s most recent rains also may have been worsened by falling on very hard, dry soils after years of catastrophic drought, which affected many parts of Kenya, killing livestock and crops and causing widespread hunger and water insecurity. This drought was made 100 times more likely by planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels, an April World Weather Attributionanalysisfound.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/04/world/why-people-enjoy-eating-chicken-ijdgi-cec/index.html\n",
            "My last memory of choosing to eat chicken was about 20 years ago. I was sitting by the pool on a sunny day at a school swimming event. My friend got chicken nuggets and offered me some; I ate about three of them and they just didn’t do it for me. I’d had nuggets once or twice before, but there was always something about the taste that I didn’t like — even when I tried various sauces. I’ve never really understood why people enjoy eating chicken. I don’t judge them for eating it — if it’s something they like, more power to them. And, despite today beingInternational Respect for Chickens Day, it has nothing to do with qualms about eating an animal. I’m a sucker for a McDonald’s Quarter Pounder and Korean barbecue. For me, it’s the fact that some people goabsolutely wildfor the taste of chicken. I’m talking about people who go miles out of their way to pick up wings or drumsticks, orthose cravings my adult friends often express out loud for chicken nuggets, which most of them refer to as “nuggs” or “nuggies.” “Man, I wish I had a 10-piece of nuggs right now!” I am absolutely mystified over the levels of chicken hype people seem to consider totally normal. Like the frenzy of people crowding Chick-fil-A or Popeyes when alimited-edition chicken sandwichgoes on sale, as if it were the latest iPhone release. Or the fact that there’s something called the “chicken sandwich wars,” whichcould return in 2024— thanks in part to the recent limited release of two new McDonald’s crispy chicken sandwiches. There are also multiple popular YouTube talk shows — thinkHot OnesandChicken Shop Date— in which the eating of chicken is a vehicle for comedy and enjoyment. When I confess my disinterest in chicken, people often get a confused look. It’s like they’re trying to solve a complex mathematical problem, or I’ve just declared I dislike sunshine or puppies. “But chicken isthe most popular meat!” they exclaim. “It’s inoffensive!” “It’s everywhere!” Yes, I fully get that for many people my preference for, well,anythingbut chicken, is weird. Given the taste of chicken, or lack thereof, and the fact that you can die from consuming it undercooked, I often wonder what it is that other people like about it that I just don’t seem to get. Watching my friends devour chicken at every opportunity is like sitting through a foreign film without subtitles. They gleefully chow down at birthday parties or grab a chicken sandwich at fast-food joints after our weekend soccer games while I sit puzzled, feeling like the only one in the room who is missing the plot. Soon after the swimming-event nugget incident, I started claiming an allergy to chicken. Thankfully, most people accepted this without question — a social get-out-of-jail-free card. But occasionally, someone was skeptical. “Is that even possible?” they would ask. I’d nod my head and slowly back away, like Homer Simpson disappearing into the bushes. My aversion to chicken might be more psychosomatic. My younger brother used to cluck like a chicken while I was eating it. Hearing the noise an animal makes while eating its meat? A highly disturbing experience. Or, subconsciously, it could be my brain shying away from eating theclosest living relative to dinosaurs, which I’ve always been fascinated by. A few years after I announcedmy supposed chicken allergy, my mom (who didn’t believe the sudden onset of my allergy for one second) secretly laced my pasta sauce with chicken. I spent the next seven or so hours throwing up, and confronted her about it. When she admitted there was chicken in the sauce, it made me wonder if Ididhave a chicken allergy. Even the smell of fried chicken repels me. I swear I can smell it from blocks away, my nose instantly wrinkling in distaste. Compared to the aroma of freshly baked bread or the sizzle of bacon — scents that beckon me closer — the fried chicken smell is like an unwelcome intrusion. Whenever someone says, “It tastes just like chicken,” I’m puzzled. This first struck me at 22, during a volunteer stint in South Africa. At a restaurant serving exotic meats, someone claimed the ostrich — delicious to my taste — resembled chicken. It didn’t. I figured they were just comforting themselves with something familiar. Trust me, I have tried to like chicken. I’ve tried it in all its forms. But at some point, I realized that I was forcing myself to eat it. Maybe it was time I just owned up to not liking chicken — no matter how people would react. I finally started doing this a few years ago. At first I often got enigmatic, “That’s weird!” responses, but that’s thankfully become less common lately. So, dear reader, please help me understand why I’m an outlier in this poultry-obsessed world.Whyexactly do you enjoy eating chicken? And if you don’t like it, please let me know. I’d love to know that I’m not alone.\n",

            "A prominent surgeon in Gaza has died in an Israeli prison after being held for more than four months, according to Palestinian prisoners’ groups, which decried his death as part of a “systematic targeting” of health care workers. Dr. Adnan Al-Bursh, head of orthopedics at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, was declared dead by Israeli prison authorities at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank on April 19, according to a joint statement Thursday from the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society and the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs. Al-Bursh was arrested along with 10 other medical workers in December during the Israeli military ground invasion of theJabalyarefugee camp,CNN previously reported. He was taken away while treating patients in Al-Awda Hospital, according to the statement. His body has not yet been released by Israeli authorities. The prisoner associations blamed Israel for his death, saying it was part of a “systematic targeting process against physicians and the health care system in Gaza,” according to the statement. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. The death of the 50-year-old was “heartbreaking news for everyone, for his family, the medical staff at Al-Shifa Hospital, and for Dr. Adnan’s patients,” the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, Dr. Marwan Abu Saada, told CNN. “This is the last thing we expected, and it’s difficult for the human soul to bear this news,” he said. “Dr. Adnan loved life, was cheerful, and was loved by everyone.” Al-Bursh’s nephew Mohammad Al-Bursh told CNN in a phone interview that he found out about the death of his uncle at around 1 p.m. on Thursday from the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society. “I didn’t know how to tell his wife and my father. News like this is hard to keep in… We are shocked, more than anyone can imagine. We are in pain,” he said. The youngest of nine siblings, Dr. Al-Bursh wasn’t just a doctor, he was also a sports adviser for the Palestinian national soccer team, his nephew said. He told CNN his uncle worked nonstop during the height of the war in Gaza, only taking an hour in the morning to jog and play sports by the beach. “From October 10, 2023, he spent every moment he had at Al-Shifa hospital. He didn’t even see his wife until probably two weeks later,” Mohammed said. During the first Israeli incursion into Al-Shifa hospital, Mohammad told CNN Israeli soldiers told the medical staff, including Dr. Al-Bursh that they could either leave the hospital and go south, or face arrest. He followed orders and went south temporarily, eventually returning to the north of Gaza when he felt the roads were safe, Mohammad said. Dr. Al-Bursh ended up moving from one hospital in Gaza to another, each always falling victim to Israeli incursions. According to Mohammad, Dr. Al-Bursh had the option to flee and take refuge in shelters in Jabalya but was determined to keep working. Until he was detained by Israeli soldiers on December 14 last year. Mohammad said he tried to get information about his uncle’s arrest from authorities and lawyers but was kept in the dark. Just like Mohammad, Abu Saada said he had earlier asked Israeli authorities about Al-Bursh’s detention but “didn’t receive any news.” Abu Saada was told that one of Al-Bursh’s fellow prisoners – who had since been released – said the surgeon had been tortured and was killed. CNN cannot independently verify the claim that Al-Bursh was tortured in detention. However,testimonyfrom dozens of Palestinians who have been released by Israel in past months has alleged the widespread use of physical and psychological abuse of those detained by Israel during the war in Gaza. The IDF has previously said it treats all detainees in accordance with international law. Anunpublished reportcompiled by the United Nations which CNN has obtained describes beatings, sleep deprivation, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence against both men and women detained by the Israeli military. Earlier on Thursday, Israel released dozens of Gaza detainees via the Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel. The release included the return of the body of Ismail Khadr, a Palestinian man from Gaza, who had also recently died in Israeli custody, the prisoner associations said in the joint statement. The total number of Palestinian detainees who have died in Israeli custody since October 7 rose to 18, the statement said. Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks when militants killed more than 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 200 people hostage. Israel’s military response has since sparked a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza that hasinflamed opinion globally. The seven-month bombardment of Gaza has killed more than 34,600 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. Half of the 2.2 million people in Gaza are on the brink of starvation and man-made famine is imminent, according to a scale used by United Nations agencies. Concerns are also heightened over an anticipated Israeli military operation in southern Gaza’s Rafah, prompting renewed calls for a ceasefire. There has been fierce criticism of Israel’s actions in and around hospitals in Gaza, as medical groups and NGOs warn the health system in the territory is on the brink of collapse. Israel has defended its incursions at medical facilities in Gaza, alleging that Hamas fighters used hospitals to run military activities through a network ofunderground tunnels. Hamas and medical staff at various hospitals across Gaza deny the allegations, and Israel has been under significantinternational pressureto prove its claims. Dr. Al-Bursh is survived by his five children, the youngest aged three, who hadn’t seen their father in nearly five months. “I walked into the mourning house yesterday and saw two of his kids jumping around expecting to see their father. They didn’t know that he was martyred,” his nephew told CNN, struggling to hold back tears. The last post Dr. Al-Burshposted on Xwas a cartoon image of him wearing his scrubs in the midst of Gaza’s destruction, with a note in Arabic that read, “We will die standing and we will not kneel… All that remains in the valley are its stones, and we are its stones.”\n",

            "Star quarterbackAaron Rodgersis expected to participate in theNew York Jets’offseason training activities (OTAs) later this month without “any restrictions,” his franchise’s coach Robert Saleh said on Friday, per the NFL website. The four-time MVP ruptured his left Achilles tendon just four snaps into his Jets career in September while making his highly anticipated debut for the team after he was traded from the Green Bay Packers, and spent last season on the sidelines recovering from the injury. Rodgers underwent surgery that week and, despite Saleh saying at the time that he would be “out for the year,” he made a swifter recovery than anticipated and returned to practice just 11 weeks after suffering the injury. But the Jets ultimately missed the postseason and the timeline for his rehabilitation shifted and now Rodgers seems to be on track for beginning the 2024 NFL season fully fit, with a full offseason of training under his belt. The 40-year-old will fully participate in phase three of the OTAs, Saleh said, in which teams can conduct 10 days of 11-on-11 drills without any contact during a four week period. His return will be “naturally managed,” Saleh added, since phase one and two in the five weeks beforehand involve only strength and conditioning, meetings, individual drills and drills conducted at a walk-through pace. “I know he’s had a couple prior engagements that he’s taking care of, but he’s here, he’s working,” Saleh said. “I mean, the guy can still sling it. Obviously, he’s still working through his rehab, but no issues on the trajectory on which he’s going.” Without Rodgers at the helm, the Jets’ offense struggled last season under the direction of third-year quarterback Zach Wilson, who was benched mid-game for Tim Boyle in Week 11 against the Bills. Boyle in turn was cut after he failed to turn things around and the Jets returned to Wilson. They ultimately finished the season on 7-10.\n",

            "https://www.cnn.com/travel/turks-and-caicos-americans-ammunition-charges/index.html\n",
            "Four Americans are charged with possession of ammunition offenses in the tropical Atlantic getaway of Turks and Caicos,according to a postfrom the Turks and Caicos Islands Government. Carrying firearms in Turks and Caicos is prohibited, according to the TCI Government. Bringing firearms or ammunition, including stray rounds, into the British Overseas Territory without prior permission from police is “strictly forbidden.” Individuals who violate the law face a minimum12 years in prison, according to an April advisory from the US Embassy in the Bahamas. A post on X from the island government said judges do have discretion to lower the minimum when there are “exceptional circumstances.” According to the post from the Turks and Caicos government, the four Americans are: Michael Lee Evans, 72; Bryan Hagerich (no age listed); Tyler Scott Wenrich, 31; and Ryan Tyler Watson, 40. Hagerich detailed his recent arrest in Turks and Caicos in an ABC exclusive after pleading guilty to bringing live ammunition into the islands while on vacation. He is expected to be sentenced on May 29, a lawyer representing him told CNN. A court heard pre-sentencing arguments from Hagerich’s defense team and prosecutors on Friday, according to his attorney, Oliver Smith. Smith said he is challenging “the constitutionality of the legislation as it relates to how the judge can sentence a defendant under the current law.” The court is expected to rule on that constitutional point and sentence Hagerich according to its ruling on May 29, Smith said. In the interview with ABC’s Matt Rivers ahead of the court proceedings, Hagerich said bringing the ammunition with him was an accident. Hagerich was arrested in February after several rounds of ammunition were found in his luggage while going through airport security, he told ABC. Hagerich and his family were leaving Turks and Caicos and returning home following a vacation with their children, he said. While at the airport, Hagerich told ABC his name was called over the PA system after his bag was selected for random search. Authorities then found hunting ammunition Hagerich said he’d forgotten was in his bag following a recent trip. Bryan’s wife, Ashley, told ABC she begged officials to go easy on them. “I remember pleading like, ‘Can’t we just pay a fine? Like it was an honest mistake,’” Ashley told ABC, “And it was a firm, ‘No.’” Hagerich told the outlet in an interview aired Friday morning that he was arrested in front of his children, aged four and six, and spent eight nights in jail. “Those were the absolute darkest days and nights of my life,” Hagerich said. Hagerich pleaded guilty to possession of 20 rounds of ammunition, according to the Turks and Caicos Islands Government. Hagerich is asking for leniency. “I’m the first to acknowledge that I take full responsibility for my actions.” But Hagerich added, “There are alternative ways that this can be handled and dealt with that are within the laws of Turks and Caicos that will allow me to return home to my family.” While out on bail, Hagerich has been sharing a short-term rental with another American recently charged under the law, Ryan Watson, he told ABC. “This is like probably the loneliest I’ve ever been in my entire life,” Watson told ABC’s Matt Rivers. “To have somebody that’s experiencing the, the very same thing as you… It gives you some bit of support,” he added. Watson was arrested at the Howard Hamilton International Airport on the island of Providenciales on April 12 for a similar offense, according toTCI police. After posting a $15,000 bail, Watson was released from jail on April 24 but was forced to surrender his passport and remain on the archipelago. His next court hearing is set for June 7, according to the TCI Government. Watson and his wife, Valerie, were detained upon departure of Turks and Caicos where they had been celebrating several of their friends’ 40th birthdays, according to aGoFundMe pageset up to help the family with expenses. Airport security found four rounds of ammunition “unknowingly left in a duffel bag from a deer hunting trip,” the post said. Valerie Watson was released of charges and allowed to return to Oklahoma, an April 23 update from the fundraising page shows. The page does not give a reason for her release. The TCI government has declined to comment further on the Americans arrested. The ammunition was “not noticed by TSA when leaving America,” the GoFundMe post said. “Now, they are facing a legal system that is unfamiliar, daunting, and expensive.” In a statement to CNN, the TSA confirmed Wednesday that four rounds of ammunition were not detected in a traveler’s bag during a security screening at Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City,from which Watson was traveling. “TSA takes its security mission very seriously,” a TSA spokesperson said. “TSA is here to protect our transportation security systems, and an oversight occurred that the agency is addressing internally.” The agency added that it is working on perfecting systems that detect prohibited items to ensure seamless and safe travel. CNN has reached out to the Watson and Hagerich families for more information on their cases and is attempting to reach attorneys for both men. Two additional Americans – Michael Lee Evans and Tyler Scott Wenrich – are also facing lengthy prison sentences for possessing ammunition, according to the TCI Government. “Travellers are strongly advised to search their luggage before they travel to the Turks and Caicos Islands to ensure they do not bring in forbidden items inadvertently,” the TCI Government post said. “The Transportation Security Administration screening in the United States may not identify ammunition in a traveller’s baggage.” Airline passengers are also encouraged to research local laws when traveling internationally and to start packing for trips with an empty bag, the TSA said. Prospective tourists considering a trip to Turks and Caicos do haveaccess to warnings from TCIand the US State Department about the British Overseas Territory’s weapons and ammunition laws – if you know where to find them online. Last month, the State Department releaseda travel warningadvising Americans to “carefully check your luggage for stray ammunition or forgotten weapons before departing from the United States. Firearms, ammunition (including stray bullets), and other weapons are not permitted in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI).  TCI authorities strictly enforce all firearms-and-ammunition-related laws.” There is also more detailed information on the department’sTurks and Caicos webpageunder the header of “Local Laws & Special Circumstances.” Travelers can find out critical information from the State Departmentfor any destination here.

            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/first-luxury-watch-buyer-guide/index.html\n",
            "Navigating the world of“haute horologie,” the highest form of watchmaking, can be intimidating for a beginner. If you’ve found yourself in the enviable position of shopping for your first luxury timepiece, you will likely have more questions than answers. From understanding the terminology, to knowing where to shop, the questions to ask yourself before you set foot in a store (or auction house) and how to avoid buying a fake, CNN Style has done the research and asked experts for their top tips. Just like buying a car, there are some technical terms prospective watch buyers can benefit from knowing. Here are a few: Crown:Small knob found on the side of the watch used to change the date and time. On a manual watch, the knob is used to wind it so the movement keeps going. Movement:The complex mechanisms that make the watch run.Bezel:The frame that holds in place the crystal protecting the watch face. Lug:The parts that connect the watch case to the bracelet (strap). Complication:A watch function beyond regular time-telling. Sometimes watches can have several added “complications.” For example, achronographhas a stopwatch, while one with aperpetual calendarshows the month and day of the week, and aGMTtells the time across multiple time zones.Skeleton:A watch that showcases rather than covers up its inner workings. Tourbillon:An additional mechanism said to improve the accuracy of a watch. Most modern-day watches do not need a tourbillon to be highly accurate, but the complicated mechanism often pushes the price up.Quartz movement:Battery-powered watch. Automatic movement:A mechanical watch that does not need a battery to move, it relies on movement from the wearer to wind. Grey market:distribution or selling channels not officially authorized by the original manufacturer like forums, Instagram or Facebook marketplace.Reference:Model number that can tell you details about the watch; what it’s made of, the design specifications etc. Blue-chip brands:Well-known and reputable watchmaker brands like Patek Philippe, Cartier, Rolex and Vacheron Constantin with history and a track record of producing excellent timepieces. Are you looking for the latest model from a trending brand, or are you interested in investing in a piece of history, or a timeless classic? If it’s a new release, bear in mind these often come with a lot of fanfare — and a long waiting list — so you may find yourself lusting after a watch that simply can’t be purchased within the timeframe you’d like. Luxury watchmakers often require buyers to effectively “prove” their commitment to buying a popular model by requiring them to buy less coveted models before they can purchase the watch of their dreams — which can have waiting lists that can be months or years long, said the head of Sotheby Asia’s watches department Joey Luk.Some, like independent watchmaker Charles Frodsham & Co. she adds, have a staggering 20-year wait.“Don’t bother with it,” said Hong Kong-based co-founder of The Horology Club Johnathan Chan, of the expectation for shoppers to buy watches they don’t need to ultimately be able to get what they want. Given the time and money involved, he believes it makes more financial sense to pay a slight premium for a watch from a reputable second-hand dealer with clear provenance. If you are open to buying second hand, there’s a thriving pre-owned luxury watch market out there, but be aware of the risks if you’re not working with a trusted dealer who is able to certify the authenticity of the timepiece pre-sale. Think carefully about where you are shopping. An unknown, first-time seller on Facebook marketplace will likely warrant more scrutiny than a well-established dealer with a long list of previous customers who can vouch for them. Auction houses such as Christies and Sotheby’s have in-house experts tasked with vetting the watches that they take in, and newer second-hand platforms such as Chrono 24 verify all the dealers on their site. This doesn’t mean fakes don’t make it onto the market, so you must do your research and — if possible — get the watch verified by the brand directly before completing the purchase. But if you’d rather not take on any risk, going direct to a retailer may be your best bet. Away from the trending new models, there are of course plenty of good quality watches to be purchased direct from the maker. “At least you know there’s someone to go to if anything goes wrong,” said The Horology Club co-founder Helbert Tsang. Don’t get sucked into hype around a watch. This is a personal investment that you’ll likely want to love wearing for a long time. Also, be careful if resale value is your main motivation. Tim Stracke, founder and chairman of leading watch resale platform Chrono24 said,“I always (advise) don’t first of all look at the financial returns,” he said during an interview at the Watches and Wonders Fair in Geneva earlier this month. “Look at the emotional return; what do you really like, what makes you smile every time you look at a piece?” Sotheby’s Luk agrees: “Always pick your favorite watch,” she said. “If you don’t like the watch and you just bought that for investment, then it’s going to be a waste, because it’s going to sit in the safe forever.” Ask yourself, what do I need the watch for? Is it something you’ll wear to play tennis or to time your swim laps? In which case you may want a sturdy, waterproof, sports watch with a high degree of accuracy, said Luk. Maybe you’re in the market for an elegant dress watch to wear to a wedding or you’re looking for a mechanical masterpiece or a conversation-starter with a unique design. Are you shopping for an anniversary or birthday present for someone special? Perhaps select a model from a year that holds sentimental value. Luk also advises first-time buyers stick with established blue-chip brands that have a longstanding history. “They have a better reputation for quality and there is more info. on the market – it would be easier for beginners to do their research, check their historic prices and compare to the recent results,” she told CNN via text message. These brands, she wrote are “more reliable and the prices are relatively stable,” compared to lesser-known brands “where there is limited info. online and it’s difficult to monitor the price.” Avoid buying anything you can’t try on yourself. Just because a watch looks good in an advert or on a celebrity’s wrist, it might not suit you. Watches can look very different in real life. Collector Carlos Pang, another co-founder of The Horology Club, found this with the Patek 3940. “It’s a 36mm diameter watch, which for a lot of people might be a bit small, looking at the specs. But, once you try it on, the way the case is (designed), it’s a bit fuller.”And remember that you’ll be wearing it for long stretches of the day, so comfort is essential. Consider the weight of the watch, and the material of the strap, for example. “I definitely value wearability a lot,” said Helbert Tsang. While on the lookout for a watch to wear to his wedding, Pang saw a six-figure Audemars Piguet watch. “I really liked that watch… but at that time I didn’t have much money,” he said. Instead, he did his research and found the designer, in this case Gerald Genta, who had made watches for other brands that were more affordable. “I went with the IWC Ingenieur in the end. I bought it secondhand and that’s the watch I wore to my wedding. I still have that one today.” Don’t rush into the decision, in fact, it’s sometimes best to shop without any real intention to buy, said Chan.“Give yourself time to figure out and try different things, whether it’s going to watch meets to check out watches, going to different stores, going to auction houses, but just experiencing more things so that you know yourself more and what you like.” Watch enthusiast groups like The Horology Clubs organize meets where members bring timepieces from their collections to show and discuss. You can find the nearest one to you with a quick search on the internet and on social media. Chrono 24’s Stracke adds:“A watch purchase is often a purchase for life… don’t mind taking the time even if it takes half a year, a year or even longer to find the piece you really want.”\n",

            "The United States has formally accused Russia of using chemical weapons “as a method of warfare” against Ukraine and imposed sweeping new sanctions on Russian firms and government bodies. Ina statement on Wednesday, the US State Department said it had “made a determination … that Russia has used the chemical weapon chloropicrin against Ukrainian forces in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).” It added that Russia had also used “riot control agents,” or tear gas, during the war in violation of the CWC. “The use of such chemicals is not an isolated incident, and is probably driven by Russian forces’ desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions and achieve tactical gains on the battlefield,” it said. The US conclusion tallies withtestimony from Ukrainian troopswho say they have faced increased encounters with gas and other irritant chemicals on parts of their frontline with Russia’s forces in recent months. In a statement posted on social media in March, Ukraine’s armed forces said they had recorded more than a thousand incidents where Russia had used “tear gas munitions equipped with toxic chemicals that are prohibited for warfare,” with 250 cases in February alone. The Kremlin dismissed the US accusations. Asked about them during a regular press briefing, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “We saw the news about this. These accusations are absolutely groundless, not supported by anything. Russia was and remains committed to its obligations in international law.” Chloropicrin was widely used as a chemical warfare agent in World War I, but is no longer authorized for military use, and is now mostly used in agriculture, according to the CDC. It irritates the lungs, eyes, and skin, and can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea lasting for weeks, according to the CDC. Under a 1991 law against the use of chemical and biological warfare, the State Department is “re-imposing restrictions on foreign military financing, US Government lines of credit, and export licenses for defense articles and national security-sensitive items going to Russia,” it said on Wednesday. It added that it is sanctioning three Russian government entities linked to the country’s chemical and biological weapons programs and four Russian companies that contributed to those government bodies. The announcement was part of a tranche ofnearly 300 new sanctionsagainst companies and figures in multiple countries for their support of Russia’s war in Ukraine, including China, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The US has previously warned Russia against chemical warfare in Ukraine; in March 2022, a month after the invasion began, President Joe Biden said that NATOwould respondif Russia used chemical weapons in Ukraine. And last April at a G7 summit, the foreign ministers of member nations said in a joint statement that Russia would be met with “severe consequences” for any use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Since then, US officials have warned of signs that Russia has done so anyway. In November,Mallory Stewart,the US assistant state secretary for arms control, deterrence, and stability, cited reports by Ukraine that Moscow was using riot control agents in the war. And Ukrainians on the front lines say they have faced increasing gas attacks.In December,a Ukrainian combat medic said they had recorded at least nine incidents where a caustic and flammable gas was dropped by drones onto Ukrainian lines. Another Ukrainian intelligence official told CNN the substance deployed by the Russians was a form of CS gas, also known as tear gas. Two soldiers who survived a gas attack told CNN they suffered injuries including burns and welts to their face, and inside their mouths and throats. The use of chemical weapons is banned by international law. Russia has signed those treaties and claims it doesn’t have chemical weapons, but the country has already been linked to the use of nerve agents against critics in recent years. Those cases include the poisonings ofSergei SkripalandAlexey Navalny– the latter of whom died in February while jailed in aa penal colony in Siberia.The47-year-old fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putinhad fallen unconscious after taking a walk, according to the Russian prison service; thecause of his deathis unclear. On Wednesday, the State Department said it would also impose new sanctions on three individuals linked to Navalny’s death: the director of the prison where Navalny was imprisoned; the head of solitary confinement who oversaw Navalny’s cell, as well as the walking yard where he allegedly collapsed and died; and the prison’s medical chief.\n",

            "Julian Assangestarted his WikiLeaks whistleblowing website on a quest for “radical transparency and truth,” a mission that turned an already polarizing personality into a notorious character and earned himcrusaders and criticsin equal measure. The long-running battle for his extradition to the United States continued this month, with US lawyers providing the UK High Court witha series of assurancesaround the 52-year-old WikiLeaks founder’s First Amendment rights and that he would not receive the death penalty if he were handed over. Those are set to be reviewed at a fresh hearing on May 20. It has been 12 years since the embattled Australian has been able to walk freely. He’s spent the past five years in London’s high-security Belmarsh prison and nearly seven years before that holed up at the Ecuadorian embassy in the English capital, trying to avoid arrest. He faces life imprisonment in the US for publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military and government documents supplied byformer Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manningmore than a dozen years ago.But recently there has been increased pressure for Assange’s case to be dismissed. Just this month, President Joe Biden offered Assange’s supporters a glimmer of hope saying his administration was“considering” a request from Australiato drop its charges against the WikiLeaks founder. The remarks were described as an “encouraging” signal by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who added that Assange had “already paid a significant price” and “enough is enough.” Born in Townsville, eastern Queensland, in 1971, Assange had a less than conventional upbringing. His education was a combination of home schooling and correspondence courses, since his family moved frequently. In his teens, he discovered a natural proficiency for computing, but his activities – which included accessing several secure systems, including the Pentagon and NASA, under the hacker alias “Mendax” – soon put him on the radar of authorities. In 1991, he was charged with 31 counts of cybercrime by Australian authorities but only received a small fine at sentencing after pleading guilty to most of the charges. Following his brush with the law, Assange worked as a computer security consultant, traveled and briefly studied physics at the University of Melbourne before withdrawing from the course. His vision when starting WikiLeaks in 2006 was that it would be a kind of online repository, which would publish anonymously submitted documents, video and other sensitive materials after vetting them. It ran for several years, uploading material ranging from the US military’s operating manual for its detention camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to internal documents from theChurch of Scientologyand some of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin’s stolen emails. But it was catapulted to global attention in 2010 with a video that later became known as “Collateral Murder.” Back then, journalist Atika Shubert caught wind of footage circulating which claimed to show a deadly 2007 US helicopter attack in Iraq. Then a reporter for CNN in London, Shubert tracked downthe individual in possession of the footage. On first impressions, Assange was “vague” and “elusive,” Shubert recalled. With the benefit of hindsight, she now believeshis behavior was the result of “sitting on this cache of documents from Chelsea Manning and trying to figure out how to publish it.” He showed up unannounced atCNN’s London office soon after, a USB stick withthousands of classified documentsin the palm of his hand. “That was my first introduction to the world of data dumps and what exactly WikiLeaks was doing - the scale of it - which I had never heard of before,” Shubert said. WikiLeaks ultimately released the video from the US helicopter attack in Iraq, sparking condemnation from human rights activists and earning rebuke from US defense officials. By the year’s end, the organization had gone on to publish nearly half a million classified documents relating to the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As WikiLeaks continued its disclosures, Assange found himself the latest cause célèbre – his every movement intensely scrutinized. And with each headline, his infamy grew among those who did not share his vision. Fidel Narvaez, former consul of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, met Assange in 2011, after WikiLeaks released another huge archive – this time of secretUS diplomatic cables. The pair became close friends through the years. “Assange can be stubborn, sometimes he can clash with other people, but once you know him … he is extremely respectful and warm. He has a great sense of humor,” Narvaez told CNN. “His one mission in life is publishing, which is what he has done with WikiLeaks.” Assange’s story, as the “teen hacker who became insurgent in information war” as theGuardianput it in 2011, sounded like the plot of a Hollywood blockbuster. Soon his tale was immortalized in documentaries and films, perhaps most notably in 2013’s “The Fifth Estate,” which Assangelabeleda “geriatric snoozefest” that used what he considered flawed source material. For journalist and author James Ball, who briefly worked at WikiLeaks and was based for a time at Ellingham Hall, a remote manor house north of London where Assange holed up before seeking refuge in Ecuador’s embassy, the infancy of WikiLeaks was an “exhilarating” time. “You were working on the kind of material that we (had) really never seen before. Leaks have become a bit more common since, but the idea that you could peruse through these huge sets of records that showed what happened in conflicts or what actually happened in closed rooms, was sort of completely new,” Ball told CNN. WikiLeaks became a household namethanks to its frequent data dumps, but some were starting to question the founder’s behavior. For many, his polarizing personality became an issue. Ball added: “He sort of liked the attention. … Heliked the fuss that (the disclosures) caused but he was oddly incurious actually about the documents.” Others offer alternative explanations for Assange’s eccentricities.Narvaez said the Assange he knew was “hyperactive and workaholic” and pointed to hisdiagnosed autism spectrum disorderas an element of his personality. Such questions aside, WikiLeaks essentially ground to a halt when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden in August 2010. The organization’s focus shifted from offense to defense, despite the transparency campaigner’s vehement denial of the allegations against him. There were mounting calls for Assange to leave WikiLeaks and, when he didn’t, many cut ties with it. Assange labeled it “a smear campaign” orchestrated to pave the way for hisfurther extraditionto the US and refused to go to Sweden for questioning. In June 2012, while out on bail from UK officials over the Swedish probe, he opted for a nuclear option and knocked on the door at 3 Hans Crescent, where herequested political asylum from Ecuador. Outside the confines of his diplomatic shelter, the world questioned whether Assange was trying to circumvent justice. Over time, his relationship with his host soured along with the arrival of a new president in Ecuador in 2017. Assange was“an inherited problem”for Lenin Moreno, who wasfacing pressure from the USto expel him from the diplomatic bolthole. “It was obvious that former President Moreno was going to give in to external and internal pressure,” Narvaez said. Narvaez, seen as too close to the unwanted houseguest, was asked to leave in July 2018 amid a shake-up of the diplomatic mission’s staff. “I left him isolated, and I was the last person he trusted,” Narvaez said. Nine months later, in April 2019, Assange waspulled kicking and screamingfrom the building by London’s Metropolitan Police on an extradition warrant from the US Justice Department. Assange has since lived, mostly isolated, in a three-by-two-meter cell at Belmarsh prison in southeast London. The prison has the capacity to hold over 900 inmates and is known for once housing infamous terror suspects such asAbu Hamza al-Masriwithin its high-security unit. The US has accused Assange of endangering lives by publishing secret military documents in 2010 and 2011. He is wanted on18 criminal chargesrelating to his organization’s dissemination of classified material and diplomatic cables. If convicted, he could face up to 175 years in prison conditions much harsher than here in the UK. Fighting his corner since he entered Belmarsh: his wife, Stella Assange. The couplemarriedin March 2022, while he was in prison. Stella, the mother of Assange’s two young sons, called her husband a “political prisoner” outside court last month and has repeatedly voiced her fear that, if extradited, he could take his own life. “I’m very concerned about how he’s doing. Physically, he’s aged prematurely,” she previously told CNN. “He’s on medication. As you know, in October 2021, he had a mini-stroke and he has all sorts of health problems.” She labeled the US’ latest guarantees that Assange could lean on First Amendment protections at trial  “blatant weasel words” in a statement on April 16. “The diplomatic note does nothing to relieve our family’s extreme distress about his future – his grim expectation of spending the rest of his life in isolation in US prison for publishing award-winning journalism,” she said. Nick Vamos, head of business crime at Peters & Peters law firm and a former head of extradition at the UK’s Crown Prosecution Service, told CNN that on the other side of the coin, some might suggest that “you should allow the judicial system to follow through to its conclusion” without being influenced by protests from supporters. Assange’s team argue he is being extradited for political reasons and that a handover to the US violates the European Convention on Human Rights. It’s a claim supported by independent experts. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, in Februarycalled on the British governmentto halt a possible extradition and reiterated her concerns about Assange’s fitness and “the potential for him to receive a wholly disproportionate sentence in the United States.” Marking Assange’s five years at Belmarsh, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard warned that Assange, if extradited, would “be at risk of serious abuse, including prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate the prohibition on torture or other ill-treatment.”﻿She added that US assurances over his treatment could not be relied upon as they are “riddled with loopholes.” Beyond the personal costs for Assange, many have expressed concern about the broader implications for press freedom around the world if he is sent to the US. Five international media organizations that collaboratedwith Assange have called the US government to end its prosecution of him for publishing classified material.In a 2022 letter,representatives for The New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, El País and Der Spiegel argued publishing is not a crime. “Obtaining and disclosing sensitive information when necessary in the public interest is a core part of the daily work of journalists. If that work is criminalised, our public discourse and our democracies are made significantly weaker,” the letter stated. Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said anyone who cares about press freedoms should not be comforted by the First Amendment assurances offered by US lawyers. He continued, “And if the government is successful, no journalist will ever again be able to publish US government secrets without risking (their) liberty.” CNN’s Xiaofei Xu and Alex Stambaugh contributed reporting.\n",

            "TikTok is facingan existential crisisin America. If its Chinese owner fails to sell the app in the next year or so, it could be banned in its biggest market. Not only would that deal another huge blow to China’s tech ambitions, it would further deepen the divide between two digital worlds centered around the rival economic superpowers. Congress on Tuesday approved legislation that could compel ByteDance to sell TikTok or face a national ban. President Joe Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on Wednesday; TikTok has already said it will challenge the law in court. Beijing has previouslysaidit strongly opposes a forced sale of TikTok, and it has revised its export control rules to give it the power to block a sale on national security grounds. That leaves few options for ByteDance to secure the future ofTikTok in the US, its biggest market with 170 million users. “A forced sale of TikTok in the US amounts to a downgrade of the app, as the Chinese government won’t approve the sale of its algorithms,” said Alex Capri, a research fellow at the Hinrich Foundation and a lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s Business School. “If TikTok is forced to stop operating in the US, ByteDance’s prospects in other mostly liberal democracies will come under further scrutiny,” he said. If the Chinese government won’t let ByteDance relinquish TikTok’s algorithm, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity. A US ban, or a less powerful version of TikTok,would be a windfall for YouTube, Google, Instagram and other TikTok competitors, as many of its customers may jump ship, Capri said. And it would be a major hit to the global ambitions of ByteDance. “It [a TikTok ban] would be the end of ByteDance’s global expansion, as it would be a sign that the Chinese state values the algorithm’s security more than ByteDance’s financial prosperity and global expansion,” said Richard Windsor, tech industry analyst and founder of Radio Free Mobile, a research company based in the US. “The implications are that the ideological struggle being fought in the technology industry will become more intense.” A ban on TikTok is also likely to accelerate a shift that is splitting the world’s tech landscape into two blocs, one centered on the US, the other embracing tech from China, according to Capri. “The move against TikTok in the US is another step towards not only a bifurcated platform economy between Chinese apps and Western apps, but also, more broadly, the bifurcation of entire the global tech landscape,” he said. “This includes everything from who owns and operates data centers, to space-based internet satellites, to undersea cables and, of course semiconductors.” In that sense, the TikTok ban has its silver lining for Beijing. “A ban in the US will spark renewed efforts to spread China’s digital footprint in Southeast Asia, and other mostly developing markets world wide,” Capri said. The TikTok legislation was included in a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Once President Biden signs it into law, ByteDance will have up to a year to complete the sale or face an effective ban for the platform. US officials and legislatorshave long expressed concernsabout TikTok’s potential national security risks, including that it could share data with the Chinese government, or manipulate content displayed on the platform. But TikTok has rejected the claims. “The new divestiture bill is the result of a concerted lobbying effort by Silicon Valley venture capitalists associated with US technology companies that stand to benefit from the China threat narrative proponents of the bill have been pushing, ” said Paul Triolo, partner for China and Technology Policy Lead at Albright Stonebridge Group. In general, Chinese companies and apps operating the US are facing growing challenges, he said. Biden administration officials are beefing up a new office at the Commerce Department to enforce provisions of a Trump-era rule on protecting US information technology supply chains that covers connected apps and could be used to push for further restrictions. “It seems unlikely that Congress would single out another Chinese company like TikTok for a specific bill, but the Commerce IT supply chain rule could be used in the future to limit the ability of Chinese companies and apps to have access to portions of the US market,” Triolo said. China’s Commerce Ministry has pledged to take all “necessary measures” to protect its interests, shortly after the House of Representativespassed an earlier version of the TikTok billlast month. But it didn’t elaborate. On Wednesday, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said in response to a question from CNN’s Marc Stewart: “On the TikTok matter, we have stated our position clearly, and I have nothing to add today.” Most American social networking apps have already been barred in China. Beijing currently blocks most US social media platforms — including Google, YouTube, X, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook — because they refuse to follow the Chinese government’s rules on data collection and the type of content shared. Triolo doesn’t expect Beijing to react “strongly” to the US ban on TikTok, though. “While Beijing is already on record as opposing any forced divestiture of TikTok US from Bytedance, its primary concern would be the transfer of technology involved,” he said. “In general, Beijing cares much less about a social media company than about US technology controls.” “Beijing will be much more likely to retaliate strongly to new US export controls, and is not likely to respond in kind to the US effort to ban Tiktok US if it eventually happens,” he added. Beijing recently ordered Apple (AAPL) to remove social messaging apps WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram from the firm’s China app store. But it has not followed up with major crackdowns on virtual private networks, which many tech savvy Chinese use to communicate with friends abroad via these messaging apps. “The move was likely timed to show that China will continue to block access to some apps it considers to be a national security threat, though the blocked apps have far fewer users in China than the 170 million or so users of TikTok in the US,” Triolo said. — CNN’s Wayne Chang and Marc Stewart contributed reporting.\n",

            "For people wanting to commune with nature, Sardinia is already one of the best places in Europe to do so. And now there’s the opportunity to get even closer – by getting married on anudist beachon the island. Is Benas beach, halfway up Sardinia’s west coast, looks set to become a destination for naturist weddings after the local authorities opted to let couples say their vows there au naturel. Luigi Tedeschi, the mayor of San Vero Milis, the closest town, said the authorities got the idea when a German couple wrote to ask whether it would be possible to marry on the beach – which has had a naturist-designated area for the past two years. But while many might laugh at the idea of exchanging vows as nature intended, Tedeschi – who had the original idea to designate part of the beach nudist – said the reason to open up for weddings was rather more serious. “I think we’re living in a delicate moment for people’s freedom, with the nationalist movements in Europe,” he said. “People protest and get rounded up by the police, or they’re intimidated. So I think we need to do things to show that people are free. Most people want freedom, not a regime.” The self-declared antifascist, who has been mayor since 2015, told CNN that the central part of Is Benas beach had always been frequented by nudists. “I just made it official, to affirm the right to freedom,” he said – adding that it’s a mixed beach, where naturists and clothed visitors exist together. “Nudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists] it’s a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature,” he added. “It should be respected – so why not? We have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism. And then we thought, let’s make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.” He said that the central part of the four-mile beach – which is flanked by two regular clothed areas – is partially hidden. “If anyone has a problem, they can walk on past, or look at the sea,” he said. Yet Tedeschi said that nobody in the town – whose 2,500 population can increase to 30,000 in summer – has complained. “There’ve been a few jokes about whether I would have to be clothed [to officiate at ceremonies] or where I’d wear thefascia[the mayoral sash] but they’re just jokes. Fundamentally, everyone is in favor,” he said. The aim is to create a network of naturist beaches across Sardinia, said Tedeschi. “That way we can create a circuit where [naturists] can find hospitality, and we can attract a very respectful type of tourism.” He said that unlike the clothed strips of the beach, where visitors often leave trash behind, “the area set aside for naturists is always pristine.” The idea is to increase tourism sustainably. “We have to have a cultural exchange – not big hotels, but small accommodation offerings that tell the story of the area. That can only happen if I greet the tourist in my home, feed them something I made – and this kind of tourism [naturism] is perfect for that. They are more in touch with nature.” The area around San Vero Milis is up there with Europe’s most beautiful coastlines. There are nearly 17 miles of beach within the jurisdiction of the town itself. Is Benas and Is Arenas, the more famous adjacent beach, are backed by vast dunes and a huge pine forest behind them. The second largest island in the Mediterranean, Sardinia is known for its pristine mountainous inland and its spectacular beaches, which devotees say are every bit as beautiful as bucket-list destinations like the Maldives. The island is also known for its archaeological remains. Down the road from San Vero Milis is Tharros, a still-standing Roman city dominating a thin peninsula, with ruins from the Phoenician and ancient Nuraghic periods. The area is also home to one of the most intriguing archaeological finds in Sardinia: the Giganti di Mont’e Prama, 28 “giant” stone figures of soldiers, archers and boxers, thought to have been carved by one ancient civilization before being ritually destroyed by the next. As for what the marrying couples will wear – reports had stated that brides would have to sport a veil – Tedeschi said that it’ll be up to them. “People can wear what they want,” he said. “As long as the principle is to affirm people’s freedom, it’s all good.”\n",

            "“You have to ask the Israelis,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Brigadier General Ali Belali says with a smirk when asked how many ballistic missilesthe Islamic Republic fired towards Israelin its April 14 strike. But he’s more than happy to show the missiles and drones Iran used in its first ever attack against Israel launched directly from Iranian soil. “It was a punitive measure,” Belali says, as he uses a laser pointer to indicate the missiles deployed, towering above him in the exhibit. Two weeks after the Middle East came to the brink of an all-out war, withIran firing hundreds of projectilestoward Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on an Iranian embassy compound in Damascus, Tehran is keen to show the world that it is capable of fighting a wider conflict should it be faced with one. On April 19,Israel respondedwith a suspected attack inside Iran’s borders. Both the Iranian and Israeli actions resulted in minimal damage and appeared by both sides to be aimed at restoring deterrence. That situation de-escalated, but thethreat of war continues to loom largeover the region as Israel’s offensive in Gaza grinds on. CNN was given rare access to an Islamic Revolutionary Guards exhibit that showcases Tehran’s air and space capabilities, including the types of weapons that were used against Israel last month. American media had never been allowed inside until now. At the permanent exhibit of the Revolutionary Guard Aerospace Forces in western Tehran, dozens of long- and medium-range ballistic missiles stand tall along with cruise missiles and drones. The exhibit is meant to show the development and progress of Iran’s drone and missile program. “Today, our drones and missiles have become an important factor of strength and the execution of power in the world,” Belali, himself a former missile commander during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war that ended in 1988, tells CNN. He says Iran’s massive drone and missile barrage against Israel was a major success. Iran’s attack on Israel included drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The night sky over Israeli cities lit up as the country’s air defenses worked to intercept the projectiles. Meanwhile, the air forces of Israel, the US, the UK, France and Jordan were busy in the skies, also trying to take down as many Iranian drones and missiles as possible. “NATO, The United States and Arab countries of the region wanted to create barriers for our drones, missiles and cruise missiles, but they failed,” Belali says. “The world was not able to stop us.” The Israeli military said that“99%” of projectilesfired by Iran were intercepted by Israel and its partners, with only “a small number” of ballistic missiles reaching the country. The Iranians claim they managed to hit two locations inside Israel, including the Nevatim airbase in the Negev desert. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that ballistic missiles that reached Israel fell on the airbase and causedonly light structural damage. “Accurate, (to) less than five meters,” Brigadier General Ali Belali claims, standing in front of two of the ballistic missiles he says were involved in the strikes against Israel, the Ghadr and the Emad.  The missiles have a range of more than 1,000 miles and can carry warheads between 450 and 500 kilograms (1,102 lbs), he says. Another missile, called Kheybar, which he says was also used, carries a warhead of about 320 kilograms, the general adds. Iran’s ballistic missiles have long been a cause for concern for the US and its allies in the Middle East, who have called for curbs on the missile program to be part of any deal that Washington strikes with Tehran. The US says Iran has thelargest ballistic missile forcein the Middle East and considers its missile arsenal as one of its “primary tools of coercion and force projection.” Iran has in the past insisted that its missile program is solely for defensive purposes. In recent years, and until its attack on Israel, Iran had carried out at least five major cross-border ballistic missile strikes in the region, John Krzyzaniak, a research associate at the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in Washington, DC, told CNN earlier. Those include two attacks on ISIS in Syria, and three in Iraq claiming to have targeted US forces, Kurdish militants and Israeli intelligence. Also on display at the Tehran exhibit is what Iran says is an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone, made by Lockheed Martin, that it claims to have downed in 2011. US officials told CNN that year that the drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Three years later, Iran said it had managed tocopy the drone. Belali says Iran’s missile development is key to the Islamic Republic’s defense strategy. “In our defense capabilities we don’t rely on anyone. We have had good progress in this field and we will progress more. There are achievements that have not yet been talked about.” Drones are equally as important for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards. The exhibit shows various stages of their drone development, starting from small wooden UAVs used in the Iran-Iraq war, all the way to models the Iranians claim have stealth capabilities. One the most prominent is the Shahed 136, a cheap “fire and forget” drone, meaning a flight path is programmed, the UAV is launched, and it then independently flies towards the target area. While the Iranians acknowledge using dozens of Shahed 136 drones to target Israel, both the US and Ukraine also accuse Tehran of giving hundreds to Russia, with Moscow using them to hit Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. The Iranians have consistently denied those claims. The Shaheds fly low and slow and usually attack in swarms, the general says, standing in front of an unmarked truck that serves as a secretive launching platform. “Everything is preprogrammed. The flight route is chosen according (to) the enemy’s capabilities and blind spots of radars and all the elements that can help us reach the target.”\n",

            "Hainan, a Chinese island that’s geographically closer to Hanoi than Beijing, is known as the Hawaii of China due to its sandy beaches and temperate weather. But there’s another reason tourists from around China are flocking to Hainan these days:space. The city of Wenchang is home to a rocket launch center – and a tourist industry that caters to a growing interest in space-related tourism. China has made no secret of its desire to develop tourism here, drawing inspiration from Florida’s Cape Canaveral – the launchpad for many famous NASA space missions. CNN visited Wenchang, on Hainan’s northeast coast, to experience the thrill firsthand ahead of the May 3 launch of the Chang’e-6 probe, which aims to explore thefar side of the moonin its 53-day mission. The interior of the Hilton Wenchang looks more like a space center than a typical tropical resort. From celestial scenes in the corridors to a rocket on the breakfast buffet, the sprawling property is inspired by the nearby Wenchang Launch Center. At the hotel gift shop, visitors can find space-inspired kids’ toys, stuffed animals and models. Ahead of the May moon mission, the hotel offered a special aerospace-inspired afternoon tea. For around $30, guests were served a platter with planet-style bite-sized cakes, chocolate planes and astronauts, and a mousse-filled rocket, garnished with blue and pink sugar crystals representing the heavens above. The space theme continues around Wenchang. Rocket designs hang from light poles and there are several displays of Chinese spacecraft – perfect for a selfie or family portrait. Bottled water sold in stores comes in containers shaped like rockets. The growth of China’s space program has fueled more interest in all things aeronautic. Hotel representatives tell CNN that room rates at the Hilton Wenchang can be seven times higher when there’s a launch. Visitors can watch the takeoff from the hotel’s beach. State media in China reports that 1.5 million people have visited Wenchang in the past two years, while the number of hotels has gone from five to more than 50. Unsurprisingly, the space program has instilled a sense of national pride in China. That’s certainly the case for photographer Yan Zehua, who has a stand in Wenchang where he sells his work on postcards. “Although it’s my 24th time, maybe, to see the rocket launch, I’m still excited about this,” he told CNN. Parents also brought their children for the big moment. Several told CNN that they hoped getting to see a launch up close would give the kids an interest in science and technology. “This is our first time digging lunar soil from (the far side of) the moon,” one mom said. “So we are happy to watch (how it is done). And I brought my daughter to watch this together.” Space-inspired attractions are just one way that China is diversifying its tourism offerings on Hainan beyond the beach. A Hello Kitty-themed resort and park is under construction with a tentative opening date in 2025. In addition, it’s easier for tourists from around the world to visit Hainan than other regions of China. The island is visa-free for residents of more than 50 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, New Zealand, Malaysia and Japan.\n",

            "Miami has a new addition to its skyline – a 66-story residential tower built byAston Martin, marking the British luxury sports carmaker’s first foray into the residential real estate market. Comprising of 391 units,Aston MartinResidences Miami sits at the mouth of the Miami River on Biscayne Bay, the firm said in a statement Tuesday. Designed in partnership with architect Rodolfo Miani of Bodas Mian Anger and built by G&G Business Developments, the 249-meter- (818-foot-) tall building houses seven penthouses, each with private pools and terraces, as well as apartments ranging in size from one to five bedrooms. The largest unit is the “Unique Triplex Penthouse,” arranged over three floors at the top of the building, which remains on the market for $59 million. The property was officially opened on Tuesday. Timed to coincide with the Formula One Miami Grand Prix, the company said in a statement that it marks “the latest distinct expression of Aston Martin’s ultra-luxury high performance brand.” Featuring an infinity pool with a pool deck, jacuzzis and cabanas on the 55th floor, the sail-shaped complex has a two-floor fitness center, two movie theaters and a virtual golf simulator. The building has a sky bar and lounge, chef’s kitchen, ballroom and private dining areas, as well as a spa, beauty salon and barber shop. Direct access to the sea via a superyacht marina is also available, plus a private butler service. Germán Coto, chief executive officer of G&G Business Developments, told CNN Tuesday that the firm wanted to work on a project in the “cosmopolitan city” of Miami, and that this piece of land was the perfect choice. “It’s an amazing plot with an excellent view of the river,” said Coto. The structure’s aerodynamic shape helps the building deal with the technical challenges presented by high winds in the area, as well as evoking the sleek shape of an Aston Martin, according to Marek Reichman, executive vice president and chief creative officer of Aston Martin. It also becomes wider from the base to the mid-section before tightening once more towards the top, making it appear to bow out over people on street level, Reichman told CNN. “That’s part of the drama,” he added. However, the process wasn’t all plain sailing. “It was difficult to achieve what we wanted because the space and the plot is kind of small,” said Coto, with the building fitting into a 1.25-acre plot of land. Meanwhile, local building regulations imposed strict standards, explained Reichman, taking into account the low-lying land and propensity for flooding. “They were some of the most amazing challenges,” he said. “You have to withstand the flooding with the windows that are on street level.” There were further obstacles due to the curved shape of the building, which means that units on the east side have an individual architectural structural component. Homeowners are able to customize their interior space with the help of the Aston Martin design team, with three style packages – Timeless, Covert and Indulgent – drawing on the company’s British heritage, as well as the building’s context. “It needs to have part of the DNA of an Aston Martin,” Reichman said. “But we are in Miami, you don’t have a cold November evening where you need to put the log fire on, so you’ve got to be considerate of the environment that you’re in.” Design elements running through the building include doors with bespoke Aston Martin handles, number plinths and kestrel tan leather door tabs. Aston Martin said that 99% of the properties sold before the building was completed. Residences were sold for $1.5 million to $8.5 million, while penthouses ranged from $16 million to $59 million. The Unique Triplex Penthouse, on the market for $59 million, comes with the last remaining Aston Martin Vulcan, an 820 brake horsepower all-carbon fiber supercar, of which only 24 exist, a spokesman for the company said. Meanwhile, buyers of the 47 Signature and Penthouse units were also able to choose between an Aston Martin DBX sports SUV or the company’s DB11 sportscar. Aston Martin isn’t the first luxury carmaker to enter the residential property market. A 63-story building from Bentleywill open in 2026along the coastline of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Featuring 216 units, the property will have an elevator designed to take residents up to their doorstep while seated inside their cars.\n",

            "A young Shaolin monk runs horizontally across a wall, intense concentration, and perhaps a hint of astonishment, visible in his face. Four other trainees at a martial arts academy near the Shaolin Temple in China’s Henan province lounge nonchalantly, seemingly unaware of the gravity-defying action taking place above their heads. Their bright orange robes and Feiyue sneakers stand in contrast to the earthen wall behind them. The blurred back of a man on the left side of the image highlights the sharp movement at its center. A monk stretching in the background demonstrates his dexterity in a split-like stance. “There’s this high-level action,” photographer Steve McCurry told CNN of the photo’s composition in a video call from his home in Philadelphia. “And these other boys are just hanging out.” The image is featured in Magnum’sSquare Print Sale, which ends May 5, alongside other photographers’ works. He shot it back in 2004, as part of a personal project, while traveling the world to document various forms of Buddhism. While he doesn’t consider himself to be Buddhist, McCurry has long been interested in the religion and applies some of its principles to his own life. The Shaolin Temple – which was founded in AD 495 on the slopes of the sacred Mount Song – is said to be the home of Chan Buddhism. Although the religion emphasizes nonviolence, the temple’s warrior monks initially practiced martial arts to defend themselves from bandits. Over time, their rigorous physical training became inexorably linked with their quest to achieve enlightenment. Today, Shaolin kung fu is widely known, and the monks’ feats in athleticism have been emulated in popular movies. The 1982 movie “The Shaolin Temple,” which launched Jet Li’s career and was filmed on location, was one of the films that brought renewed interest in the monastery. By the time McCurry visited in 2004, dozens of martial arts schools had sprung up on the road leading up to the temple. “It’s incredible to watch them perform and train,” he said. “You can’t imagine that people can actually do that with their bodies.” McCurry started his career working at a local newspaper after graduating from Pennsylvania State University. He then started traveling abroad as a freelance photographer, shooting images of people in some of the world’s most dangerous and remote places. His career took off in earnest after he snuck across the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan in 1979, right before the Soviet invasion. He smuggled film out by hiding it in his clothing, providing the world some of the first photos of the conflict that left at least 500,000 Afghans dead and millions displaced. His 1984“Afghan girl”photograph – which captured the piercing green eyes of a 12-year-old refugee in Peshawar, Pakistan and was featured on National Geographic magazine’s June 1985 cover – is one of the world’s most famous photos. Over the course of his 50-year career, McCurry, now 74, has filled more than 20 passports, snappinganimalsand festivals, worshippers and fighters, conflicts and catastrophes in destinations from Niger to India. He captures the ancient against the modern, the curious amid the day-to-day and accentuates the familiarity of strangers. In 2016, McCurry came under fire when one of his photos in an exhibition was discovered to be digitally altered. Hesaidit had happened in his studio while he was out traveling, but more images that appeared to be manipulated began surfacing, igniting a debate around the ethics of photojournalism. In response to the allegations, the photographertold Timemagazine later that year that beyond the brief stint at the local newspaper in Pennsylvania, he had never been employed by a newspaper, news magazine or news outlet. As a freelancer, he had taken on various assignments, including advertising campaigns. He said his work had “migrated into the fine art field” and that he considered himself a “visual storyteller.” He added that he understood it could be “confusing … for people who think I’m still a photojournalist,” and that going forward, he would only use Photoshop “in a minimal way, even for my own work taken on personal trips.” Before shooting the photograph of the wall-running monk, McCurry had already paid a visit to the Shaolin Temple two decades earlier. He says it was “really empty” during that first trip, and he saw only “bicycles and people in these Mao suits.” By the time he returned, a kung fu craze had gripped the nation. The area felt more commercial, he recalled. Tens of thousands of (mostly) Chinese boys and men were inspired by a wave of kung fu movies, and were training at the dozens of schools in the area. The photographer was granted permission at one of the academies and spent a few days with the monks as they went about their daily routine, which included practicing acrobatics on repeat. Some of the boys ate with McCurry at a noodle joint across the street, sharing their hopes to eventually land jobs in security services, performance troupes, as well as the entertainment industry. “They were normal kids,” he said. “But they were very, very dedicated and serious about this practice.” He captured other photographs of monks’ intense training regimes during his stay, including several hanging upside down by their feet, hands calmly pressed into a prayer pose. McCurry sought to find the right combination of variables like the subject, angle, light, and background, as the monks perfected their moves. “It’s a (matter) of photographing and going back again and again.” His perseverance paid off. “It’s a picture that evokes a lot of emotion,” he said of the final shot of the wall-running monk. “It either brings a smile to people’s faces, or they’re kind of in awe of the physicality of these young boys.”\n",

            "Staff and visitors have been left stranded and buildings submerged at Kenya’s famous Maasai Mara nature reserve, as the death toll incatastrophic floodingin the country’s southwest rose to at least 188 people. Local authorities ordered some tourist facilities in the National Reserve to close after River Talek, one of the tributaries of the Mara River, burst its banks and swept through more than a dozen riverside tourist lodges and camps. Videos on social media showed some buildings and vehicles fully submerged inside the popular park as tourists scrambled to leave affected areas. Weeks of heavy rain and flash flooding has ravaged parts of Kenya for days, leaving dozens of peoplemissing around the capital, Nairobi, and causing a devastating mudslide in the town of Mai Mahiu. Two more bodies were retrieved from the site of the mudslide, bringing the total number of deaths there to 50, government spokesman Isaac Mwaura said on Thursday, revising downthe earlier figure of 71 reported due to an error, Nakuru County governor Susan Kihika told CNN. In Maasai Mara, camp owners were told to leave the affected properties and “move to higher ground further away from River Talek,” governor of Narok county Patrick Ole Ntutu said on Wednesday. But local administrators went even further in their warnings, threatening legal consequences for people still left behind, even accusing those who stay of attempting suicide. “We will forcefully evacuate anybody left in any homes or lodges along the river. We will take action against them because that is considered attempted suicide,” Narok county commissioner Kipkech Lotiatia told reporters. Authorities said they had deployed two helicopters to rescue stranded tourists and local staff around the national reserve after receiving distress calls. The flooding was caused by swollen rivers after several days of continuous rainfall, the county said on X. A tour guide told CNN he was awoken by sounds of rushing water after 1 a.m. on Thursday. When he left his tent, flood waters rose to his waist and the entire Talek Bush Camp had been surrounded. “My driver and I were the first to wake up, so we woke up all the 14 international tourists and 25 staff and climbed ladders to some water tanks that are raised,” 27-year-old James Apolloh Omenya told CNN via telephone. “We were being rained on from around 2 a.m. to 5.30 a.m. but we couldn’t get out and the planes coming to rescue us couldn’t get in one time.” The Kenya Red Cross said it had rescued more than 90 people and at least 14 camps around River Talek had been closed. While parts of the Mara have flooded before in Kenya’s so-called long rains season, locals say the scale of this year’s deluge has been unprecedented. The country has deployed “corps from the Paramilitary Academy” of its National Youth Service to Narok to “join the multi-agency team for search and rescue operations following the heavy downpour,” a statement on X said. The Horn of Africa, a region of East Africa that includes Kenya, is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world. Heavy rains have also affected Tanzania and Burundi. “Kenya is facing a worsening flood crisis due to the combined effects of El Niño and the ongoing March-May 2024 long rains,” International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) CEO Jagan Chapagainsaid in a post on Xearlier this week, referring to the climate pattern that originates in the Pacific Ocean along the equator and impacts weather all over the world. “The unfolding devastation highlights the government’s obligation to prepare for and promptly respond to the foreseeable impacts of climate change and natural disasters,” saidNyagoah Tut Pur, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement Thursday. “Kenyan authorities should urgently ensure support to affected communities and protect populations facing high risk.”\n",

            "Boris Johnson was turned away from apolling stationwhile trying to vote in the United Kingdom’slocal electionsafter forgetting to bring photo ID – a requirement he introduced while prime minister. Polling station staff were forced to turn the former prime minister away as he tried to cast his ballot in South Oxfordshire on Thursday, PA media reported. Johnson returned later with the necessary ID and was able to vote. New rules requiring photo ID to vote were introduced by Johnson’s Conservative government in the Elections Act 2022. The law was widely criticized when it was introduced. The UK’s Electoral Commissionwarnedin 2023 that the law could exclude hundreds of thousands of people from voting and particularly impact the unemployed or members of ethnic minorities. Areportby a cross-party group of members of Parliament warned in March that millions of voters face being disenfranchised at the next general election due to the country’s electoral registration system. It said the voter ID requirement “left individuals without the right ID being prevented from voting and only a number of forms of ID being permitted.” Among those turned away from polling stations Thursday was army veteran Adam Diver, who said he was “gutted” when he was unable to vote his veterans’ ID card was not accepted. Veterans minister Johnny Mercer apologized to Diver. “The legislation on acceptable forms of ID came out before the veterans ID cards started coming out in January this year. I will do all I can to change it before the next one,” Mercer said. Local elections were held across the country for more than 100 councils and several mayors Thursday. With around a third of the results declared, the loss of more than 100 seats on local councils and one parliamentary seat in a by-election suggest that national polls in which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his party trail by a distance are correct. The results also mean that if a general election were held tomorrow, the opposition Labour Party would almost certainly win power.\n",

            "Panama, the Central American nation at the crossroads of international trade and migration, will elect a new president on Sunday after a campaign season mired in legal uncertainty. “It’s a very important election, the most important since after the US invasion” in 1989, said Daniel Zovatto, a global fellow with the Latin America Program at the Wilson Center, a think tank. “The situation is very complex and the next president, whoever is elected, is going to have an agenda overloaded with problems in a country that is very polarized and undergoing a lot of political tension and uncertainty,” he added. At stake is the financial stewardship of a country of 4.4 million people, which is facing high inflation and a stagnating economy that has led to widespread unease. Water access will also factor high into voter’s minds, analysts say: droughts exacerbated by El Nino have made access to potable water scarce in some regions and reduced the capacity of thePanama Canal, a centerpiece of the country’s GDP. Once a GDP leader in the region, Panama’s economy has slowed dramatically in recent years, with the IMF forecasting GDP growth of only 2.5 percent this year, down from 7.3 percent last year. In March, credit agency Fitch downgraded Panama’s rating to junk status citing “fiscal and governance challenges” that followed a controversial decision to close the country’s largest mine last year. Among the favorites, José Raúl Mulino, a rightwing former public security minister, has pledged to return the country to its economic heyday and totackle high unemploymentwith a plan to incentivize private hiring with government funds. More controversially, Mulino has also vowed to shut down the Darién Gap, thetreacherous stretch of junglebeginning in Panama that’s become a main highway for migrants making their way to the US – a phenomenon that is fueling political chaos in the United States as Americans prepare for their own presidential vote this fall. More than half a million migrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed through the Darién Gap in 2023, according to the Panamanian government, twice the amount recorded in 2022. The US has been working for months with officials in Panama and Colombia, where the jungle ends, to attempt to shut down the route. Mulino has not said how he would carry out a closure of the jungle to migrants, and some analysts “question whether this would stem migration or simply prompt new routes,” an Americas Society/Council of the Americas report said. For Panamanian voters, corruption is top of mind as they head to the polls, according to recent Gallup polling, followed by unemployment, unsatisfactory medical care, and the cost of living. The case of former President Ricardo Martinelli, who was disqualified from running by the courts because of a past corruption conviction, stands out. Martinelli was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison last year after being convicted of money laundering in the so-called “New Business” corruption scandal. The case related to a publishing group that, according to the country’s public ministry, was purchased with funds that came from state contracts that were handled irregularly. Martinelli, who maintains his innocence, is currently taking refuge from local authorities in Nicaragua’s embassy in the Panama City, and Nicaraguan authoritieshave granted him asylum. Once the favorite to win this year’s presidential race, Martinelli was disqualified from running by Panama’s electoral court in March because of the conviction and sentence. Mulino, who had been Martinelli’s running mate, then took over the ticket for the Achieving Goals party. But Mulino’s candidacy was challenged as well and under judicial review until just days before the election, injecting uncertainty into the race. On Friday, the country’s Supreme Court decided that Mulino’s candidacy was constitutional and therefore could proceed. There are seven other presidential candidates, including current Vice-President José Gabriel Carrizo, former President Martín Torrijos, and Rómulo Roux, another former minister under Martinelli. There is no presidential runoff in Panama and no minimum threshold to win, so an eventual victor could succeed with far less than majority support from the electorate. Martinelli has thrown his support behind Mulino, even releasing campaign videos from inside the Nicaraguan embassy. Mulino in turn is widely seen as having inherited Martinelli’s popular support and mirroring his plans to revive policies from the president, which is “remembered largely for economic growth and poverty reduction, which resonates with voters facing high inflation and unemployment rates,” Americas Quarterly wrote.\n",

            "Sadiq Khan has won a third term as London’s mayor, capping a round of local elections across England that confirmed the political supremacy of the Labour Party and spelt misery for Britain’s Conservative government. Khan won 43.7% of the vote, beating Conservative challenger Susan Hall by about 11 percentage points to extend his control of the capital that began in 2016. It followsa string of victoriesaround England for Labour, who are firmly positioned to take power from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his Conservatives in a general election in the coming months. The Conservatives lost control of 10 local councils and nearly 500 councilors on Thursday, suffering an electoral drubbing at the hands of the public that virtually everyone – including those within the party – had expected. Labour leader Keir Starmer told reporters on Saturday: “I am sorry, I don’t care which political party you support, if you leave your country in a worse state than when you found it 14 years later, you do not deserve to be in Government for a moment longer.” But Sunak likely found enough slender scraps of success to withstand a challenge to his leadership, which rebellious Tories had threatened depending on the outcome of Thursday’s elections. The party was hoping to keep hold of the mayoral position in the West Midlands on Saturday, after previously holding the same position in the Tees Valley, giving the increasingly beleaguered Sunak something to seize onto as he looks to at least unify his lawmakers in Westminster. Thursday’s polls marked a final dry run before the general election, which must take place by January. Sunak has resisted calls to outline when he will hold that vote, and Labour leads opinion polls by a huge margin. Starmer’s opposition party won control of eight councils, and also stormed to victory on Thursday in a Westminster by-election in Blackpool. The results confirmed the conventional polling narrative that the group is on track to win power, though Labour could not quite pull off the barnstorming red wave that some in the party had hoped for, falling short in some of the trickiest contests it faced. And there were indications too that discontent among the party’s position on Israel’s war in Gaza hurt Labour among voters in areas with large Muslim populations. In particular the loss of Oldham council, a north-west English town, where around a quarter of the population is Muslim. “We do recognise the strength of feeling that there is and of course we will continue to work just as we do in every area across the country to earn votes back in future,” Labour’s shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the BBC. If his victory is confirmed, Khan would become the first mayor of London to serve a third term since the post was created in 2000. The city, home to nine million people, is more multicultural, liberal and pro-European than the UK as a whole, leading Khan to occasionally clash with successive Labour leaders, especially over the issue of Brexit. He has prioritised emissions-cutting policies in an effort to shed the city’s reputation as a major polluter, and made international headlines during a long-runningpublic spatwith former US President Donald Trump during his administration. But critics have attacked Khan’s record on knife crime and his recent expansion of a world-first low-emissions zone, which the Conservatives said would hit poorer families in outer London the hardest.\n",

            "A Russian court has placed Forbes journalist Sergey Mingazov under house arrest after he was detained for allegedly spreading fake news about the Russian armed forces, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti has reported. Forbes Russia says its journalist will be under house arrest for at least two months as he awaits trial after being detained on Friday. RIA reported on Saturday that: “Forbes journalist Mingazov, detained in the case of spreading fake (news) about the Russian Armed Forces, has been placed under house arrest.” On Friday, Mingazov’s lawyer Konstantin Bubon said that the journalist had been detained for “reposting a publication about the events in Bucha (Ukraine)” on Telegram. Mingazov’s Telegram channel had 476 subscribers at the time of publishing this article. It shows that he reposted stories about the Russian militaryallegedly committing atrocitiesin Bucha, near the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, from other news outlets such as the BBC’s Russian outlet and Radio Freedom. Bubon said that Mingazov is accused of spreading “knowingly false information” about the Russian armed forces “under the guise” of reliable reporting. The city of Bucha was liberated by Ukrainian forces at the end of March 2022, having been occupied near the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February the same year. According to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, the Russian army committed thousands of war crimes in the Bucha district, with hundreds of civilians killed in the town. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the mass killings and has reiterated baseless claims that the images of civilian bodies were fake. Bubon told Forbes Russia that Mingazov’s house arrest was enforced as a “preventative measure.” In Russia, preventative measures take place pre-trial and include being remanded in custody, released on bail, or placed under house arrest. Bubon also told Forbes Russia that the court had banned Mingazov from using the internet and imposed restrictions on his communications with people other than relatives, investigators, lawyers, and medical professionals. On Saturday, without naming Mingazov, Khabarovsk territory’s Investigative Committee stated that it had chosen house arrest “as a preventative measure,” after charging a man with the public dissemination of knowingly false information about the Russian armed forces. “In April 2022, a man, acting out of political hatred, posted a publication on a news channel he administers, intended for viewing by an unlimited number of people,” the Investigative Committee alleged. “It contained, under the guise of being reliable, deliberately false information about… the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation,” it continued. Russia has been cracking down on journalists since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Several prominent journalists have been arrested, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty editorAlsu Kurmashevaand Wall Street Journal reporterEvan Gershkovich. Courts have also ordered the arrests in absentia of several journalists for criticizing the state, including Alexander Nevzorov, Dmitry Gordon, and Marina Ovsyannikova. On Saturday, a local Russian court press service said that Konstantin Gabov, a Russian journalist it said worked as a producer for the Reuters news agency, was detained and accused of “extremism.” Gabov allegedly helped to produce content for a YouTube channel associated with late opposition leader Alexey Navalny called “NavalnyLIVE,” the Basmanny District Court press service said. The court said Gabov was involved in the “preparation of photo and video materials” for the YouTube channel and would remain in detention for at least two months, until June 27. Russian authorities designated Navalny and his organizations as “extremist,” meaning anyone associating with his group faces a legal risk. CNN has reached out to Reuters for comment.\n",

It is tasked with the responsibility of naming a new prime minister and cabinet. The committee will exercise certain presidential powers until a new president-elect is inaugurated, which must take place no later than February 7, 2026. The country’s former prime minister, Ariel Henry, resigned last week as the council was sworn in and the former finance minister, Michael Patrick Boisvert, has been filling the role on a temporary basis. Still to come are the tasks of appointing a new head of government and a cabinet; coordinating the arrival of a multinational security force to reclaim the capital; and eventually holding long-overdue elections. But Haiti’s gangs maintain they deserve a seat at the negotiating table. One of the gangs’ leaders, Vitel’homme Innocent, toldCNN recentlythat if the gangs do not get a seat, they would try other means. The gangs oppose the council, he added, saying it was more of the same, and it was time for the old political elites to go – a view held by many in Haiti. Since February, attacks by an insurgent alliance of gangs in the capital Port-au-Prince mean the city’s international airport and seaport have ceased to function, breaking vital supply lines of food and aid and triggering an exodus of evacuation flights for foreign nationals. With the cityvirtually cut offfrom the outside world, hospitals have been vandalized while warehouses and containers storing food and essential supplies have been broken into as the social fabric frays. According to the UN, nearly 5 million people in Haiti are suffering from acute food insecurity – defined as when a person’s inability to consume adequate food poses immediate danger to their lives or livelihoods. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

            "Umberto Motto had always dreamed of playing for Torino FC. He had dreamed of pulling on the team’s maroon shirt in front of thousands of adoring fans. And he had dreamed of hearing his name announced as he made his way onto the pitch at the Stadio Filadelfia. A local boy born in the northern Italian city of Turin and the captain of Torino’s youth team, Motto seemed destined to represent his boyhood club. His dream did come true – and sooner than he expected – but the day was a living nightmare. On May 4, 1949, Motto was giving a tour of Turin to two clients of his parents’ factory, which manufactured shirts for Torino and the Italian national team. Motto recalls a dense fog that hung over the city and says it hadn’t stopped raining for seven days straight, leading the river Po to burst its banks in places. So bad was the weather that Motto decided to abandon sightseeing in the city and take the two visitors up to the Superga hill and Superga Basilica that overlook Turin, hoping to at least send the tourists home with a view to remember. The weather, however, was even worse and the fog meant they could barely see a few metres in front of their faces, much less the city below. On their way back down into Turin, the trio stopped for coffee and Motto remembers conversing with the café owner about how unusually bad the weather had been. When they arrived back in the city, they were met by another unusual sight: the roads packed with cars all honking their horns. “We thought something good had happened,” Motto, now 93 years old, recalls to CNN. Motto returned to the Torino FC headquarters in the city where he was met by the building’s caretaker, Mario Lanati, who quickly ushered him upstairs. “Umberto, you have to know that something disastrous has happened,” Lanati told him. “The plane crashed.” A confused Motto replied: “Which plane?” Lanati’s answer would irrevocably change Motto’s life and the lives of everyone associated with Torino. The plane Lanati was talking about had been carrying almost the entire Torino first team from Lisbon, Portugal where it had been playing a friendly match against Benfica. With the approach to Turin-Aeritalia Airportaffected by the weather conditions, the plane crashed into the side of the Superga hill, killing all 31 people on board. Among the dead were 18 of Torino’s first-team players, its coaches, Italian sports journalists, and flight crew. It remains one of the biggest sporting disasters in history and immediately wiped out one of the greatest teams Italian football has ever known. That Torino side, affectionately known as ‘Grande Torino’ due to its incredible success, had been on the brink of securing a fifth straight Italian league title, while its players also formed the backbone of the Italian national team at the time. The impact on the city and its people was devastating. Author Roberto Pennino spent years interviewing those affected and recounts the sense of loss in his book‘Immortal Torino,’which has been released in English for the 75thanniversary of the disaster. “These players who perished on Superga, they were really approachable,” Pennino tells CNN. “You could see them all over town. They went to the same restaurants, to the same cinemas, to the same bakeries as their supporters. “So when they perished, they were – as a team – missed deeply, but also in the city itself. All the places they would be seen, and people could have a chat with them. A lot of people felt like they lost a relative.” On top of the emotional scars that remain visible even 75 years later, Pennino says the sporting cost for Torino was “disastrous.” The club didn’t have the money or transfer coffers it does today. All of Torino’s capital was on the pitch, Pennino explains. It’s players. Clubs were supportive during Torino’s plight. To an extent. Other Italian teams loaned – and even gave – players to Torino, Pennino says. “But never the best players, of course,” he adds. Club president Feruccio Novo tried desperately to rebuild the team but would never achieve his goal. “He had an idea to make a second ‘Grande Torino’ and to buy stars, to honor those players, but also to keep up the with the results they had,” Pennino says. But there was no money, and the support from other teams just wasn’t enough. After winning five straight championships, Torino has won the first division title just once in the intervening 75 years, lifting the trophy in 1975-76. Still trying to process what Lanati had told him, Motto remained in denial. Surely, this was impossible, he thought. He had just been on Superga and heard and saw nothing. Lanati sat Motto down by the radio and told him to listen. The next news report confirmed the tragedy. As the minutes and hours slowly ticked on, more and more people affiliated with the club began to arrive at the headquarters; the rest of the youth team, the players’ wives and, finally, club president Novo. Motto remembers Novo, who only missed the trip to Lisbon due to an illness, had to be physically held up by two fans as he entered the building. “He was literally destroyed,” Motto says. “Like all of us.” Motto says Novo considered the team more like sons than players. Some journalists had also managed to make it into the building, Motto recalls, and were asking questions to those present. They were met with only silence. “No one had the courage to speak,” Motto says. “Because we understood that faced with a situation like this, there is no possibility of conversation.” Days later, the players’ families received the postcards they had been sent while the team was in Lisbon, a poignant detail that Pennino says still gives him goosebumps. With just four matches of the season remaining, the rest of the league and the Italian federation agreed to award Torino the title, but the team still needed to finish the season. The federation accepted a proposal from Torino that it would play its youth team, the champions of Italy at the time, against the youth teams of its four remaining opponents. Before the first match against Genoa – just 11 days after the crash – Motto remembers Novo coming into the changing room and hugging each player individually, before telling them: “Boys, your masters are watching you.” Even the referee had words of encouragement, according to Motto. “Forza ragazzi,” the referee told the Torino players: “Come on, boys.” As the captain of the youth team, Motto was also made captain for the remaining four matches and led the team out onto the pitch against Genoa at the Stadio Filadelfia. Motto had made it. His dream was fulfilled. Only it had come in the most unimaginable of circumstances. Torino’s youth players beat Genoa 4-0 in an atmosphere Motto has never forgotten. The level of noise usually only reserved for a goal boomed from the stands with every pass the team made. After beating Genoa, Torino went on to earn victories over Palermo, Sampdoria and Fiorentina in the final games of the season. “They honored their mentors in the best possible way,” Pennino says. As many as 700,000 fans are estimated to have lined the streets as the players’ caskets were driven through the city just two days after the crash. Today, the club continues to honor its heroes and will hold a service on Saturday, the 75thanniversary of the disaster, at the Monumental Cemetery in Turin, where some of the players are buried. Later that afternoon, there will be a mass in the Superga Basilica before the day finishes with a service at the Torino FC memorial at the top of the hill. “Theyare still remembered every year,” Pennino says. “On May 4, the names are exclaimed on the Superga Hill. It’s a worthy tribute to those great players.”\n",

            "Google has fired an additional 20 workers that it says wereinvolved in protests last weekover the company’s cloud-computing contract with the Israeli government, bringing the total number of workers fired to 50, according to the group organizing the demonstrations. No Tech for Apartheid, the organizers of the protest at Google offices last Tuesday, said in a statement Monday evening that Google had fired an additional 20 workers, on top of the 30 workers terminated last week. No Tech for Apartheid claims that some of the workers fired were “non-participating bystanders” during last Tuesday’s sit-in protests at Google’s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, and not actively involved in the workplace activism. The statement decried the mass firings as “an aggressive and desperate act of retaliation” by the tech giant. A Google spokesperson declined to share exactly how many workers had been terminated because of the protests but confirmed additional firings had taken place in a statement to CNN on Tuesday morning. Google had conducted an investigation into the “physical disruption inside our buildings on April 16,” the spokesperson said. “Our investigation into these events is now concluded, and we have terminated the employment of additional employees who were found to have been directly involved in disruptive activity,” the Google spokesperson added. “To reiterate, every single one of those whose employment was terminated was personally and definitively involved in disruptive activity inside our buildings. We carefully confirmed and reconfirmed this,” the Google spokesperson said. The organizers of the protest, meanwhile, say that some of the workers fired did not cause any disruption inside Google offices. “Google is throwing a tantrum because the company’s executives are embarrassed about the strength workers showed at last Tuesday’s historic sit-ins, as well as their botched response to them,” the No Tech for Apartheid group said in a statement. “Now, the corporation is lashing out at any worker that was physically in the vicinity of the protest—including those who were not at all involved in the campaign.” The worker group also vowed to continue its workplace activism at Google, saying they hope to send a message to company executives that: “We will not stop fighting, and we will not back down.” The protests from Google workers over the company’s cloud-computing deal with the Israeli government come more than six months since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants left some 1,200 dead in Israel, and as Israel’s counteroffensive attacks in Gaza have now killed at least 34,097 people in Gaza, according to the latest tally from the Palestinian health ministry. More than 70% of those killed in Gaza have been women and children, according to the ministry. The ongoing civilian carnage in Gaza has deeply divided the American public, and massive protests over US government and business support for Israel have erupted on college campuses and across corporate America in recent weeks. Last week, in the wake of the protests at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai sent a company-wide memo to staffers urging them to keep “politics” out of the workplace. The chief executive told workers that “this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers.” Pichai went on to urge Googlers to not “fight over disruptive issues or debate politics” in the workplace.\n",

            "China’s coast guard fired water cannons that damaged a Philippine vessel on Tuesday, marking the latest flare-up of violence between the two countries in the disputed South China Sea, Philippine authorities said. The Philippine Coast Guard said the incident occurred as one of its ships and a fisheries agency vessel carried out a “legitimate patrol” near Scarborough Shoal, a Chinese-controlled rocky outcrop 130 miles (200 kilometers) west of the main Philippine island of Luzon and inside Manila’s exclusive economic zone. Video supplied by the Philippine Coast Guard showed two larger Chinese vessels firing water cannons from opposite sides of the Philippine ship. “The Philippine vessels encountered dangerous maneuvers and obstruction from four China Coast Guard vessels and six Chinese Maritime Militia vessels,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Jay Tarriela said in thestatement. The Philippine Coast Guard ship suffered “damage to the railing and canopy,” according to its statement. No injuries were reported. In aposton social platform Weibo Tuesday, the China Coast Guard said it had expelled the Philippine vessels for “intruding” into the waters, “in accordance with the law.” Beijing asserts ownership over almost all of the South China Seain defiance of an international court ruling. Over the past two decades, China has occupied a number of obscure reefs and atolls far from its shoreline across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports. Scarborough Shoal, whichChinacalls Huangyan Island and is also known as Bajo de Masinloc, is a small but strategic reef and fertile fishing ground. There are no structures on the shoal, but China has maintained a continuous coast guard presence around it since 2012, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. The Philippines also said Tuesday that China had reinstalled a 380-meter (1,247-feet) floating barrier that “covers the entire entrance of the shoal, effectively restricting access to the area.” Scarborough Shoal is one of several disputed islands and reefs in the South China Sea, which have long been a flashpoint of territorial disputes between the two nations. In March, Chinese coast guard shipsfiredwater cannons against a Philippine vessel on a resupply mission to a contingent of Filipino marines on another contested South China Sea feature, Second Thomas Shoal, causing “heavy damages.” That shoal sits about 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the coast of the Philippine island of Palawan. In the 1990s the Philippines grounded an aging World War II-era transport ship called the BRP Sierra Madre on the shoal, to help enforce its claim to the area. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is staffed by marines stationed on rotation. Following that incident, the China Coast Guard said on Weibo it had taken “control measures in accordance with the law” against the Philippine vessels, which it said had “illegally entered the waters adjacent to Ren’ai Reef,” as Beijing calls Second Thomas Shoal. Earlier in March, Chinese water cannon hit a Philippine resupply boat as it headed to Second Thomas Shoal,shattering windowsand injuring four Filipino sailors. Beijing and Manila’s South China Sea disputes have heated up since the 2022 election of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has taken a stronger line against China than his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte. The clashes have also raised fears they could lead to a wider conflict, as Manila maintains a mutual defense treaty with the United States, which Washington says covers Philippine vessels in the disputed waterway.\n",

            "Eleven people and a dog were rescued from the raging flood waters in Kenya on Wednesday, the country’s Red Cross has said. The rescue happened at around 5 a.m. local time as the Red Cross team helped families to safety amid torrential downpours in Kitengela, Kajiado County, located south of the capital Nairobi. The humanitarian agency described the rescue mission as “challenging” but later offered a glimmer of hope with reports that floodwaters were gradually receding. However, more rains are forecasted this month, according to government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura, who warned that “heavy rainfall in specific areas threatens to exacerbate ongoing floods.” Heavy flooding in Mai Mahiu, 20 miles north of Nairobi, earlier in the week killed at least 71 people and dozens remain missing. In the last 24 hours, 10 Kenyans have died from the flooding, bringing the government’s official death toll up to 179, including 15 children. Residents in Mai Mahiu are frantically sifting through heaps of debris to recover bodies trapped by the floods. When CNN visited the town on Tuesday, corpses could be seen accumulating beneath toppled trees and layers of mud. A phone could be heard buzzing underground, and locals quickly shifted their efforts to find the source of the noise before eventually pulling out the owner’s lifeless body from the flood debris. The residents, mostly neighbors and relatives of those missing, dug through the mud with their bare hands. They had little equipment and resources but banded together to help in whatever way they could. One resident, a motorbike taxi rider who did not wish to be named, told CNN that he had provided fuel for a power saw used to cut down uprooted trees. “Ask the government to send us excavators,” the man said. Facing mounting criticism, Kenyan President William Rutosaid Tuesday thathe’s ordered the military to deploy personnel to help find missing people. “The military has been mobilized, the National Youth Service has been mobilized, all security agencies have been mobilized to assist citizens in such areas to evacuate to avoid any dangers of loss of life,” Ruto added. “It is not a time for guesswork, we are better off safe than sorry,” he added. Citizens in the worst affected areas have been ordered to leave due to fears of more rain. “We are asking every Kenyan in such areas to leave because the forecast is that rain is going to continue and the likelihood of flooding and people losing lives is real,” Ruto said when visiting Mai MahiuTuesday. Ruto added that the government has completed “mapping of all areas that are in danger of flooding, of mudslides so that we can assist citizens to move away from those areas.” Mwaura also said Tuesday the government has set up 52 “displacement camps,” to provide those affected by the flooding with temporary accommodation.\n",

            "The last time Mona Awda Talla saw her daughter Shahed alive, she was leaving the house to go buy her some cake, wearing pink pants. The 10-year-old stopped to play foosball with her friends beside the cake shop inGaza’sAl-Maghazi refugee camp. Moments later, she was dead. Grief-stricken and sobbing, Awda Talla said she still can’t believe that her only daughter will never come home. A video showing the aftermath of the strike that killed Shahed captured her sprawled on the ground next to her friends, her pink pants impossible to miss. “There is no Shahed now. Every time she came in, she said, ‘Mom.’ I would say, ‘My soul, my soul,’” Awda Talla told CNN. “My soul is gone.” In the two weeks since the attack, the Israeli military’s statements have shifted, but it has not taken responsibility for the strike that ultimately killed Shahed and 10 other children. An analysis of the site of the attack, documented by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, paints a very different picture of Israeli military responsibility. Three munitions experts who reviewed videos and photos showing damage caused by the strike and shrapnel left in its aftermath, independently drew the same conclusion: that the carnage was likely caused by a precision-guided munition deployed by the Israeli military. Chris Cobb-Smith, a former British Army officer and weapons expert, who has experience investigating munitions used by Israel in Gaza said that, based on available imagery of the aftermath, he believed the strike was “absolutely” caused by a precision-guided missile fired by an Israeli drone. “It’s certainly a light missile fired by UAV — by a drone,” Cobb-Smith. “There’s a certain aspect of this particular missile, which is very evident — it’s clearly a small munition,” and has devastating consequences, he added. The missile landed just a few meters away from Shahed and her friends at the foosball table. At that range, their deaths were inevitable. CNN documented fragments of the munition collected at the scene by Shahed’s uncle, including what appeared to be a part of a circuit board. The strike left a small crater in the road, and imagery from the scene showed surrounding buildings pockmarked with tiny holes, which weapons experts said was indicative of fragmentation caused by a sophisticated missile. Chris Lincoln-Jones, a former British military officer and an expert in drone warfare, told CNN that the circuit board uncovered at the scene was crucial to distinguishing the munition. Artillery shells have very few electronic components, and a circuit board suggests a sophisticated, precision-guided weapon was deployed. N.R. Jenzen-Jones, a munitions specialist and director of the research company Armament Research Services (ARES), said that the “remnants strongly suggest a guided munition, most likely a guided missile or loitering munition,” but added that he was unable to identify conclusively the specific type of weapon from the fragments. Cobb-Smith said he believed there was “no question” that an Israeli munition was used in the attack, saying Palestinian militants “do not have anything with this amount of sophistication” in their arsenal. The Israeli military surveil the Gaza Strip on a near constant basis and weapons experts CNN spoke to say this type of munition would not be fired without first assessing the area, raising questions about how the decision was made to carry out the strike. There have been growing questions over the Israeli military’s chain of command, especially in light of an investigation by+972 Magazine and Local Call into the military’s use of artificial intelligence to help assess and approve bombing targets. CNN has pressed the Israeli military for details about the strike, which took place on April 16 at about 3:40 p.m., according to video evidence. Two days after the strike, in response to CNN providing the time and coordinates for the attack, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck a “terror target” in Al-Maghazi but declined to provide any additional details. An IDF spokesman said they were unaware of the number of casualties, but that the incident was under review and the military was working to locate the strike in its records. Two weeks later – and three days after CNN shared its analysis of the strike in which the children were killed – the Israeli military said it did not have any record of it. “The strike in question was carried out at a different time than described in the query, and was approved based on an accurate intelligence indication,” the Israeli military statement said, referring to CNN’s request for response. “The collateral damage as described in the query is not known to the IDF.” But Palestinian journalists reporting in Al-Maghazi said there was no other airstrikes on that day. Metadata from videos filmed on two different iPhones in the immediate aftermath were timestamped at 3:40 p.m., the time CNN provided the IDF. The Israeli military declined to provide any additional evidence to back up its claims. It also declined to answer questions regarding the nature of the target or whether any militants were killed. One week after the strike, children had already returned to play at the foosball table where Shahed and other children were killed. But they said they were still afraid. “When the strike hit, I was on my way to play foosball,” Mahmoud Beha Abdel Lattif said. “Every time before I go to sleep, I think of what happened here. I don’t sleep well, I’m always afraid to sleep.” Sama, one of Shahed’s friends, was with her the day she was killed — spared only by her thirst. “I went home to drink water and the strike hit,” Sama said, wearing a beaded necklace Shahed made her. “I miss her a lot.” Others were not so lucky. For nearly 16 days, 8-year-old Ahmed Abu Jayyab fought for his life in a hospital bed at Al-Aqsa Martyr’s hospital with a fractured skull and bleeding in his brain. He died Thursday morning, becoming the eleventh child killed by that strike.\n",

            "Flooding is intensifying in Texas, where more rain is expected over the weekend in the wake of strong storms and downpours that swept away vehicles, damaged homes and triggered evacuations. Most of the rain will fall over western and central Texas, but higher rain chances return for the greater Houston area on Sunday. The heaviest downpours in central Texas will occur upstream of the flooding in Houston, potentially exacerbating flooding in a region where 12 river gauges have reached major flood stage. This week’s storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Some communities north of Houston picked up nearly two months’ worth of rain Thursday. This rainfall plunged roadways underwater and forced rivers to overflow, leading to evacuations and water rescues. Here’s what’s happening in South Texas Friday evening: •San Jacinto County, 60 miles north of Houston: About 100-200 homes are affected by floodwaters and mandatory evacuations are in effect. The event is “85% worse than Hurricane Harvey,” Emmitt Eldridge, the county’s emergency management coordinator, told CNN. Eldridge said since they are downstream from Dallas along the Trinity River, “we are expecting to see a lot more water” because of additional rainfall. “Anything they deal with, we deal with,” he added. According to Eldridge, there have been at least 58 water rescues in the county so far. More rain is expected in the area next week. •Walker County, about 70 miles northwest of Houston: Authorities are calling the floods historic there as well. “This has been a historic flood for Walker County. We have flooded more from this event than we did during Hurricane Harvey,” Sherri Pegoda, Walker County’s deputy emergency management coordinator, told CNN. According to Pegoda, two communities are underwater along the Trinity River and are only accessible via high-water vehicles. “Almost all roads in Walker County were completely submerged Monday night and into Tuesday,” Pegoda said. “We still have approximately 43 roads that are flooded with several major washouts and a couple of bridges that have been compromised.” At least 42 high-water rescues have been performed in the county since April 28, she added. •Polk County, about 80 miles northeast of Houston: Roughly 700 homes have been flooded, according to emergency management officials, who warned additional rainfall could keep flood levels on the rise in the coming days. A total of 1,000 homes are in a mandatory evacuation zone in the county, Polk County Judge Sydney Murphy told CNN. A flood warning remains in effect Friday for the County. The judge said they were concerned and keeping an eye on what was happening north of the county with the flooding because it would impact the area. “Due to continuous rainfall across East Texas and rising levels in creeks and rivers, flood levels may increase. Please remain aware of changing flood levels along the Trinity River and ALL low-lying levels. If you wish to evacuate, please do so now!,” the emergency management office recently said in a Facebook post. •Harris County, which includes the city of Houston and several northern suburbs: Mandatory evacuations have been in place since Thursday for residents on the east side of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River. The river hit major flood stage on Thursday and is forecast to crest Saturday morning just a few feet shy of the record level during Harvey. “We want you out of this area… this is a life-threatening situation,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said at a newsconference. The level of water rise anticipated will impact elevated structures and may rise to reach rooftops or power lines, according to Hidalgo. In the Harris County suburb of Crosby, a school bus driver spotted flooding over a road that had not yet been barricaded, stopped the bus and had the middle and high school students on board exit through the rear door, according to a statement from the school district. Another bus brought the students to school, where they were provided with breakfast and dry clothes, the statement added. • Liberty County, about 45 miles northeast of Houston: The Coast Guard transported a 12-hour-old baby girl by helicopter from Cleveland, Texas, Friday. The girl was experiencing low oxygen levels at Texas Emergency Hospital, which does not have a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a news release from the Coast Guard. Due to flooding, she could not be transported by ambulance on the ground. The helicopter took the girl and her mother to Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, where the baby was reported to be in stable condition, the release added. Voluntary evacuations due to flooding were also in place for Montgomery County, just to the north of Harris County. Disaster declarations are active for over a third of Texas counties after Gov. Greg Abbott expanded the storm-related declarations in response to the flooding, according to a news release. Additional counties could be added in the coming days, particularly with more storms in the forecast. Parts of eastern Texas have received anywhere from three to seven times their typical rainfall over the last three to four weeks. The repeated bouts of heavy rainfall soaked soils, making many areas extremely prone to both flash and river flooding. Nearly a foot of rain fell in some spots from Thursday to Friday morning, delivering the final blow. Periods of rain will continue through Friday evening, and an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain are possible. The worst flooding is confined to southeastern Texas where at least a dozen river gauges – including parts of the San Jacinto and Trinity rivers – are in major flood stage, the highest level, as of Friday morning. Several more sites are forecast to experience major flooding by the weekend and could meet or exceed record levels set during Harvey. Hurricane Harvey createda widespread flooding disaster in Houstonafter dropping 30 to 40 inches of rain across the entire metro in just 48 hours. While this week’s ongoing flooding is notable, it’s much less widespread and occurring north of where Harvey’s worst rain fell. As torrential rain flooded eastern Texas, severe thunderstorms spun up tornadoes both north and south of the Abilene area in west Texas.There were eight reports of tornadoes Thursday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A “large and extremely dangerous” tornado impacted the towns of Hodges and Hawley – about 10 miles north of Abilene – Thursday evening. Around 30 homes in Hawley were shredded by the tornado’s winds, with entire sections of some homes left completely exposed. Cars in the area also sustained damage from flying debris. There were “numerous” injuries, but no deaths as of Friday morning, Hawley Police Chief Brad Wilson told CNN. At least one area school district is allowing students to study from home or take time to recover Friday, following Thursday evening’s damaging tornado. “The Hawley community has been hit pretty hard and we have several families that have lost homes,” the Hawley Independent School District said in a Facebook post. Rainfall totals from flooding in Texas and Louisiana this week showed nearly two feet of rain in five days, according to the National Weather Service. Totals ranged from 23.56 inches in Groveton, Texas, to 18.42 inches in Livingston, Texas.

            "Human rights groups are calling for the release of a Saudi woman, who they say has been sentenced to 11 years in prison for supporting women’s rights and for the way she dressed. Manahel al-Otaibi, a 29-year-old fitness instructor and women’s rights activist, was sentenced during a “secret hearing” before the kingdom’s Specialized Criminal Court on January 9, 2024, Amnesty International and the London-based Saudi rights organization ALQST said in a joint statement Tuesday. However, the decision to imprison al-Otaibi only surfaced weeks later, after the Saudi government replied to a request by United Nations Special Rapporteurs for information about the case, the watchdogs say. Al-Otaibi “stands accused of terrorist offences and was arrested in accordance with the law under a legally valid warrant,” Saudi Arabia’s mission to Geneva said in a letter in January, in response to the UN request. Amnesty and ALQST allege Al-Otaibi’s charges are related “solely to her choice of clothing and expression of her views online, including calling on social media for an end to Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship system, publishing videos of herself wearing ‘indecent clothes,’ and ‘going to the shops without wearing an abaya’.” Her sister, Fawzia al-Otaibi, faces similar charges but was able to flee Saudi Arabia after she was summoned for questioning in 2022, they said. Saudi Arabia’s authorities “must immediately and unconditionally” release Manahel al-Otaibi, as the decision to imprison her “directly contradicts the authorities’ narrative of reform and women’s empowerment,” Amnesty and ALQST said. “Manahel’s conviction and 11-year sentence is an appalling and cruel injustice,” said Bissan Fakih, Amnesty International’s Campaigner on Saudi Arabia. “With this sentence the Saudi authorities have exposed the hollowness of their much-touted women’s rights reforms in recent years and demonstrated their chilling commitment to silencing peaceful dissent.” Following her arrest, al-Otaibi was subjected “to physical and psychological abuse” in the Malaz Prison in Riyadh, the groups said. She told her family in April that she was being held in solitary confinement and had a broken leg as a result of physical abuse, Amnesty and ALQST said. CNN is unable to independently verify these claims. CNN has reached out to the Saudi government for comment on the accusations. In its letter to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the kingdom’s mission to Geneva said that “no person is held in detention in Saudi Arabia for exercising their rights and freedoms,” and that “state institutions have a legal obligation to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly irrespective of their religion, race, sex or nationality.” While Saudi authorities have removed some of the restrictions on women under the male guardianship system, “many discriminatory features remain in place,” the watchdogs said. “The long-awaited 2022 Personal Status Law, which was supposed to be a major reform, in fact serves to codify rather than abolish many restrictive elements of the system, including matters of marriage, divorce, child custody and inheritance,” Amnesty and ALQST said. Al-Otaibi “ironically” believed in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s pledge for reforms, “yet she was arrested on 16 November 2022 for exercising exactly these freedoms,” Amnesty and ALQST said. Al-Otaibi’s sentencing comes “amid an intensified crackdown on free speech in Saudi Arabia, including online expression,” the groups said. Over the last two years, Saudi courts have “handed down lengthy prison terms on dozens of individuals for their expression on social media, including many women,” they said.\n",

            "The Kentucky Derby is already dubbed the “greatest two minutes in sport” but this year’s race will hold even more historical relevance as it celebrates its 150th anniversary. Since the first edition in 1875, the race has become the longest continuously held sporting event in the US, and arguably one of the most loved. Over the years the Kentucky Derby has seen sporting drama, controversy and has crowned some of the best race horses in history. This year promises to be no different with a legendary jockey attempting to win his first Derby, and the ongoing absence of the most recognizable name in the sport. The Kentucky Derby will take place on Saturday, May 4, with television coverage starting at 2.30p ET on NBC and Peacock. The race itself is set to start at 6.57 p ET. The first Kentucky Derby waswatched by a crowd of 10,000people who saw three-year-old chestnut colt Aristides, ridden by jockey Oliver Lewis, triumph at Churchill Downs. The Derby has been held at the same venue since, even during both World Wars and the Great Depression of the 1930s. This year, over 150,000 are expected to descend onto the famed racetrack to watch the race and revel in the celebrations. Some of the greatest horses have won the Derby, including the likes of Secretariat, American Pharoah, Citation and most recently Justify. The Kentucky Derby is also the first leg of the prestigious Triple Crown, a feat which consists of the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes – only 13 horses have won all three races in a single year. While the race and the venue has remained much the same, work has been underway to improve safety for horses at the track. Last year,Churchill Downsannounced new safety initiatives as part of an ongoing investigation into aseries of horse deathsat the track. Over the past 12 editions, the pre-race favorite has gone on to win the Kentucky Derby six times and Fierceness is looking to extend that record this year. The colt has enjoyed an impressive record to date, winning his last race with ease after demonstrating a frightening turn of foot. Trainer Todd Pletcher and jockey John Velazquez will hope Fierceness can deliver the pair a second Kentucky Derby victory together, after their partnership saw success in 2017 with Always Dreaming. According to the odds, Fierceness will face its toughest competition from Sierra Leone but there is a field of 20 runners all looking to win the first jewel of this year’s Triple Crown. Among them is Society Man, an outsider with a very special jockey onboard, Frankie Dettori. The Italian made his name in Europe as one of the best jockeys in the history of flat racing. Over the course of his glittering career, Dettori has ridden some of the best horses on the planet, claiming over 3,300 wins. Among his multiple career highlights are two consecutive victories in thePrix de l’Arc de Triompheand a Breeders’ Cup Turf title, all on board wonder horseEnable. Last year, the 53-year-old delayed his retirement plans to compete in the US where he has seen plenty of success already. In April, Dettori rode six straight winners at Santa Anita in California, at cumulative odds of more than 77,000-1. A win on Saturday, in just his second attempt at the race, would be right up there with his most impressive career achievements. His dream of winning the race, though, was dealt a blow after he drew an unenviable wide berth for the start. “To me, as a veteran jockey, I realize what the Kentucky Derby means for my trade. It would be an amazing feather in my cap if I can pull it off. Just getting to the field is winning,” Detorri, who will be followed by Netflix cameras on the day, toldNBC Sportsearlier this year. The 150th edition of the Kentucky Derby will be run without arguably the most recognizable name in the sport, Bob Baffert. The 71-year-old, who has trained six Derby winners, has been banned from competing in the race since his horse Medina Spirit tested positive for a banned substance after initially being declared the winner in 2021. The suspension was initially for two years but was extended by Churchill Downs Incorporated (CDI), the organizer of the horse race and owner of the famed racetrack, to cover this year’s race. Baffert “continues to peddle a false narrative concerning the failed drug test of Medina Spirit,” a CDI statement readlast year, explaining the decision. The trainer’s request for an emergency hearing was denied by the Kentucky appeals court judge last month, meaning Baffert-trained Muth, one of the best horses in the country, won’t be allowed to run.\n",

            "A pair ofRussianjournalists have been detained on “extremism” charges and face accusations of working for a group founded by the late Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny. Konstantin Gabov and Sergey Karelin are accused of producing content for Navalny’s prominent YouTube channel, “NavalnyLIVE,” which publishes videos investigating corruption in the Kremlin that have amassed millions of views. Russian authorities have designated Navalny, whodied in an Arctic prison in February, and his organizations as “extremist.” Members of his team have previously been imprisoned and many live in exile. Gabov was allegedly involved in the “preparation of photo and video materials” for the YouTube channel, Moscow’s Basmanny District Court press service said. He was arrested Saturday and will remain in detention until June 27. The court said Gabov is a producer for Reuters news agency, which has continued to operate in Russia since Moscow launched itsinvasion of Ukrainein February 2022. CNN has asked Reuters for comment. Karelin was arrested in Russia’s northwest Murmansk region on Saturday and is accused of “participation in an extremist organization.” He previously worked for a number of outlets including the Associated Press (AP) and German publication Deutsche Welle (DW), until DW was banned in Russia in 2022. An AP photo showed Karelin, who has dual Russian-Israeli citizenship, sitting in a glass cage in a Murmansk court on Saturday. The pair’s detention comes amid a heightened crackdown in Russia on journalists and Kremlin critics, as President Vladimir Putin has sought to stifle dissent more fiercely than before the invasion of Ukraine. Forbes journalistSergey Mingazovwas also placed under house arrest Saturday after he was detained for allegedly spreading fake news about the Russian army, state media RIA Novosti reported. Navalny was Putin’s most formidable political opponent before his death in a penal colony, where he was serving a more-than-30-year sentence on extremism charges. Navalny’s family and supporters have accused Putin of being responsible for his death, a claim rejected by the Kremlin.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/23/tech/congress-tiktok-ban-what-next/index.html\n",
            "President Joe Biden signed a bill Wednesday that could lead to a nationwide TikTok ban, escalating a massive threat to the company’s US operations. Congress had passed the bill this week as part of a wide-ranging foreign aid package meant to support Israel and Ukraine. It wasapproved by the Houseon Saturday, and by the Senate on Tuesday. The legislation poses the most serious risk to TikTok since US officials beganraising concerns about the app in 2020. Under what is now US law, TikTok is forced to find a new owner within months or be banned from the United States entirely. Here’s what we know and how it could affect you. The bill that Biden signed gives TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, 270 days to sell TikTok. Failure to do so would lead to significant consequences: TikTok would be prohibited from US app stores and from “internet hosting services” that support it. That would effectively restrict new downloads of the app and interaction with its content. Biden’s decision to sign the bill on Wednesday puts the deadline for a sale at January 19, 2025. Under the legislation, however, Biden could extend the deadline another 90 days if he determines the company’s made progress toward a sale, giving TikTok potentially up to a year before facing a ban. TikTok is threatening legal action to oppose the law. In a videoposted to TikTok, company CEO Shou Chew told users, “Rest assured: we aren’t going anywhere.” “We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,” he added. “The facts and the Constitution are on our side and we expect to prevail.” In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson called the law “unconstitutional” and said it “would devastate” the platform’s 170 million US users and 7 million businesses that operate on the app. A similar TikTok bill had beenpassed by the House in March, but it stalled in the Senate. In a procedural move, House Republicans this month attached a revised TikTok bill to the foreign aid package in hopes of forcing the Senate to vote on the TikTok legislation. Bundling the bill with the foreign aid — a top US priority — fast-tracked the TikTok bill and made it more likely to pass. If TikTok can’t separate from ByteDance by the deadline, then US TikTok users could hypothetically be cut off by mid-January. But that is still a big “if.” So for now, TikTok fans can continue using the app as before, though they might begin to see more creators — or the company itself —speaking outin the app to oppose the legislation. TikTok promised to take the US government to court if Bidensigned the bill. In a memo on Saturday, a top TikTok executivewrote to employeesthat this would be the “beginning, not the end” of a long process to challenge what the company calls unconstitutional legislation that censors Americans’ speech rights and that would harm small businesses that depend on the app. In March, Chewvowedto continue fighting, “including (by) exercising our legal rights.” First Amendment experts say a bill that has the ultimate effect of censoring TikTok userscould be shot downby the courts. “Longstanding Supreme Court precedent protects Americans’ First Amendment right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad,” said Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “By banning TikTok, the bill would infringe on this right, and with no real pay-off. China and other foreign adversaries could still purchase Americans’ sensitive data from data brokers on the open market.” A court challenge could lead to the measure being temporarily blocked while the litigation plays out, likely over multiple years. But if a court declines to grant a temporary injunction, TikTok could have to scramble to comply with the law. The trouble is that TikTok’s parent is subject to Chinese law, and the Chinese government is on record opposing a sale. In recent years, China has implementedexport controls governing algorithms, a policy that would seem to cover the incredibly successful algorithm that powers TikTok’s recommendation engine. If the Chinese government doesn’t want to let ByteDance relinquish TikTok’s algorithm, the thinking goes, it could block the sale outright. Alternatively, it may allow TikTok to be sold but without the lucrative algorithm that forms the basis for its popularity. Can TikTok still succeed without its algorithm? That would be the difficult question facing the company in the event of a forced sale. Without the secret sauce that has propelled the app to 170 million US users, the app could be as good as dead.\n",

            "Three bodies were found Friday in the Mexican region where an American and two Australians have been missing for several days, multiple sources told CNN. Authorities haven’t confirmed if the bodies correspond to the three missing tourists, a source said. But a local police source told CNN that authorities have found their pickup truck, burned out, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) from where the bodies were found. The human remains were found on a cliff to the south of Ensenada municipality, Baja California, according to two security sources and a member of an activist group specialized in searching for missing people. American Jack Carter Rhoad and Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson were reported missing on April 29, according to Reuters, citing the Baja California prosecutor’s office. The three friends are believed to have been on a surfing and camping trip near Ensenada town, about 60 miles south of Tijuana. Mexican officialspreviously saida vehicle, tents, and a cell phone had been found during searches of the area where the men were last seen. Three Mexican nationals were being questioned in connection with the case, though it is unclear if they are suspects. One of the sources said the area where the bodies were found — about 50 miles south of Ensenada town — is difficult to access and that rappelling equipment will be used to recover the bodies. The burned-out white pickup truck had been discovered at a ranch in Santo Tomas, a local police source told CNNE on Friday. Despite the lack of identifiable markings, which were burned off, the vehicle was confirmed to be the same one Callum Robinson posted an image of on Instagram a week ago, according to police sources working on the investigation. Around noon on Friday, a CNNE producer witnessed investigators removing the truck at the Santo Tomas ranch. Investigators took the car to a police station for further investigation, CNNE witnessed. A US State Department spokesman told CNN it is aware of reports of the located bodies and is closely monitoring the situation, adding: “At this time we have no further comment.” The family of Jake and Callum Robinson were on their way to Mexico, hoping to get “as close as possible to the area where they were last seen,” they said in a statement to Channel Nine News, a CNN affiliate. The Robinsons said: “Callum and Jake are beautiful human beings. We love them so much, and this breaks our hearts.” Channel Seven, also a CNN affiliate, reported that the siblings had attended the Coachella music festival a week before crossing into Mexico from San Diego, planning “to surf for a few days,” citing another statement from the family. “Surfing is a passion they both share. Our only comfort right now is that they were together doing something they passionately love,” the parents said in a statement to Channel Seven.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/middleeast/ceasefire-hostage-deal-talks-tensions-israel-intl/index.html\n",
            "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under fierce pressure from far-right members of his government not to agree to the ceasefire proposal currently on the table, which could prevent an Israeli military offensive in Rafah from moving forward. Hamas is considering a new framework for a deal proposed by Egypt that would see as many as 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for a pause in the hostilities in Gaza that have raged for nearly seven months, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations told CNN. US Secretary of StateAntony Blinkenon Wednesday capped off his seventh round of shuttle diplomacy in the region since Hamas’ October 7 attack, as the Biden administration continues to push for a “ceasefire that brings the hostages home.” But Orit Strook, Israel’s settlements minister and a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, suggested that accepting the deal would “throw” Israel’s military progress and the sacrifices of its soldiers “in the trash,” only “to save 22 or 33 or I don’t know how many.” Speaking to Israel’s Army Radio (GLZ) on Wednesday, she said a government that could accept such a deal after calling up “hundreds of thousands” of reservists has “no right to exist,” she said. Her comments caused outrage among some Israeli lawmakers and highlighted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s struggle to appease the most extreme wing of his coalition. Strook’s remarks come as Netanyahu mulls an incursion into Rafah, the southernmost point of Gaza to which more than 1 million Palestinians have fled after being displaced and where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel’s destruction of much of the north of the Strip. Despite domestic and international pressure to agree to a hostage-ceasefire deal, a vocal part of Netanyahu’s coalition have urged Israel’s military to continue into Rafah, prioritizing the destruction of Hamas over the return of Israeli hostages. Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s far-right finance minister, said Tuesday that accepting the proposed deal would mean “raising a white flag, and a victory for Hamas.” “We have reached a crossroad in which Israel should decide between a clear victory and being defeated in this war with humiliation,” he said, urging Netanyahu not to accept the deal. Itamar Ben Gvir, Israel’s National Security Minister, said last week that Netanyahu had “promised that Israel would enter Rafah, assured that the war would not end, and pledged that there would be no reckless deal.” “I believe the prime minister understands very well the consequences if these assurances are not upheld,” he warned. While Netanyahu faces pressure within his coalition to torpedo the deal, large parts of the Israeli public are demanding he accepts it. Families of the hostages blocked the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv on Thursday morning, calling on the governing to reach a deal to bring their loved ones home. “Rafah or the hostages – choose life,” read a banner held by the protesters. Video from the scene showed a small group of protesters blocking seven lanes of the highway with traffic backed up out of sight. Former Israeli Prime Minister and opposition leader Yair Lapid hit back at Strook’s remarks. “A government with 22 or 33 extreme coalition members has no right to exist,” he wrote on X. Benny Gantz, a member of Israel’s war cabinet but widely seen as Netanyahu’s most formidable rival and a potential successor,saidover the weekend that the return of the hostages held in Gaza was more pressing than an operation in Rafah. “Entering Rafah is important in the long struggle against Hamas. The return of our hostages, abandoned by the 7.10 government, is urgent and of far greater importance,” said Gantz, referring to the October 7 Hamas’ attacks on Israel when more than 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 people taken hostage. “If a responsible outline is reached for the return of the hostages with the backing of the entire security system, which does not involve the end of the war, and the ministers who led the government on 7.10 prevent it – the government will not have the right to continue to exist and lead the campaign.” Strook accused the radio station of misrepresenting her remarks and later sought to clarify her comments, saying that a deal would “finally abandon many of the hostages.” Any deal with Hamas would also see Israel abandon its efforts to “destroy the Hamas regime,” she said. The new framework proposed by Egypt calls for Hamas to release between 22 and 33 hostages kidnapped in Israel and since held in Gaza in exchange for a pause in the fighting in the Strip, an Israeli source told CNN. The latest proposal, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, is laid out in two phases. In the first phase, between 22 and 33 hostages are to be released over several weeks in exchange for the pause and the release of Palestinian prisoners. In the second phase, which sources have described as the “restoration of sustainable calm,” the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and bodies of hostages are to be exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. Blinken met with Netanyahu in Tel Aviv Wednesday, following stops in Saudi Arabia and Jordan earlier this week. “We’re determined to get a ceasefire that brings the hostages home, and to get it now,” Blinken said during a meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, adding the “only reason that wouldn’t be achieved is because of Hamas.” “We also have to be focused on the people in Gaza who are suffering,” he added, saying the focus also needs to be on “getting them the assistance they need, the food, the water, the medicine, the shelter.” Outside the building where Blinken and Herzog met, protesters gathered outside holding posters and chanting, urging US President Joe Biden to “stop the war,” “save the hostages” and “bring them home.” This story has been updated.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/04/world/eta-aquariid-meteor-shower-scn/index.html\n",
            "May kicks off with the Eta Aquariid meteor shower, and experts are anticipating a better show than in recent years, according to theAmerican Meteor Society. During the period when the meteor shower is expected to peak — in the early morning hours of Sunday and Monday, according toEarthSky— the moon, in its new moon phase, will only be 6% illuminated. Experts suggest keeping an eye on the sky between 2 and 5 a.m. local time. The Eta Aquariid shower is often considered the best meteor shower of the year for the Southern Hemisphere, where sky-watchers could see between 20 and 40 meteors each hour, or perhaps even more, according to EarthSky. In the Northern Hemisphere, observers can expect to see between 10 and 20 meteors in the hours before dawn, according toNASA. The source of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is Halley’s comet. Earth crosses the comet’s orbital path each spring between April and May, causing small grains of rock and dust shed by the comet to strike our planet’s atmosphere and create a dazzling meteor display. It happens again in October, resulting in the Orionid meteor shower. Halley’s comet was last visible streaking across Earth’s night sky in 1986, and it will swing back by in 2061 as it travels on a 76-year orbit around the sun. The meteors appear to be coming from the northeastern part of the Aquarius constellation, which contributes to the name of the shower. The rate of visible meteors per hour this year is “expected to be enhanced by debris perturbed by Jupiter in a direction closer to the Earth,” according to the American Meteor Society. “This last occurred in 2013, when rates were significantly enhanced.” Astronomers anticipated higher rates from the Eta Aquariids in 2023, but a full moon outshone the meteors, and scientists couldn’t verify whether the enhancement occurred. But with no lunar interference on the horizon, the rate of visible meteors could double if the enhancement happens, according to the American Meteor Society. If you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights that will obstruct your view. Find an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone — so meteors are easier to spot. The American Meteor Society is inviting spectators toshare their observations of the shower, which will help astronomers determine whether there were more meteors than expected. “The eta Aquariids will offer a good chance of seeing the strongest activity from this source until the 2040’s,” according to a post shared by the American Meteor Society.“We highly encourage everyone with clear skies to observe during this time and to share your observations. We wish you good luck and look forward to seeing your results!” Here are the remaining meteor showers to anticipate in 2024. Southern delta Aquariids: July 29-30 Alpha Capricornids: July 30-31 Perseids: August 11-12 Draconids: October 7-8 Orionids: October 20-21 Southern Taurids: November 4-5 Northern Taurids: November 11-12 Leonids: November 17-18 Geminids: December 13-14 Ursids: December 21-22 Each month’s full moon is associated with a specific name, according to theFarmers’ Almanac. But the full moons have a variety of names and meanings, according todifferent Indigenous tribes.

This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it can’t completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a “ring of fire” in the sky as the sun’s fiery light surrounds the moon’s shadow. A partial lunar eclipse, when Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.

            "At least five journalists were killed in Mexico last year, dozens have been arbitrarily arrested in Cuba and Venezuela, and others forced to flee Nicaragua due to harassment. These are just the tip of the iceberg of the challenges faced by many media workers in Latin America, where experts say the status of press freedom is increasingly worrisome. In a report published in March, Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)defined Mexico as “the most dangerous country for the press in the Western Hemisphere”. In an interview with CNNE, Francisco Cobos, a Mexican-American journalist for Univision, recounted his attempted kidnapping by armed men in Tamaulipas on April 26. They forced him to stop his car, pointed a gun at him and tried to force him into an alley. Miraculously he managed to flee. “There is no longer a place where you are safe,”said Cobos. Since he resides in McAllen, Texas, Cobos filed a complaint there and not in Mexico. Upon learning of the incident, the Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledged to offer him protection. According to the CPJ report, Mexico has “the highest number of missing journalists in the world” with at least 15 professionals in 2023. According to the rights group Article 19, in 2023 a total of 561 aggressions against the press have been registered in the country and the murders of five journalists. According to the same organization, at least 43 journalists have been killed during the administration of López Obrador, 47 during the administration of former President Enrique Peña Nieto and 48 during the administration of former President Felipe Calderón. An emblematic case was that ofjournalist Lourdes Maldonado López, killed in January 2022 in the border city of Tijuana. In 2019, Maldonado López, who worked for several media outlets, including Televisa and Séptimo Día, told López Obrador directly in a public press conference that she feared for her life and asked him for protection. After her death, the president referred to the case, describing her death as “regrettable” and promising to investigate. In February 2022, three people were arrested in connection with that homicide. On April 26,a new murder was added to Mexico’s grim statistics: Roberto Figueroa, who worked in the online portal “Acá en el Show,” from Morelos. The Prosecutor’s Office confirmed in a press conference that they believed the crime was linked to his journalistic work. López Obrador has promised security to journalists, but his relationship with the press has had several tense moments, including lashing out against CNN en Español’s Andres Oppenheimer for his interview with Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who criticized Lopez Obrador “ignorant”. Last week,the Mexican president criticizedthe US State Department’s report on human rights in the world, which refers to concerns over press freedom in Mexico, saying that US authorities should “be respectful”. “In Cuba, they have killed journalism, they kidnapped the profession,” journalist Abraham Jimenez told CNN. Jimenez left the island in 2021 after a period of threats, arbitrary interrogations and house arrests. The harassment was fueled by his reporting on Cuba’s street protests of 2021. As he recounted, Jimenez was portrayed in state media as a CIA agent, causing his friends to stay away out of fear and causing his family members to lost their jobs. “They didn’t need to shoot me, they had killed me civically,” he said. This is how he recalls his exodus to Spain, where he now resides: “They told me: ‘We are tired of you, we are going to give you your passport, but if you don’t leave the country, you are going to jail’. I didn’t think twice, and I left’”. According to Article 19’s report “Cuba: resistance in the face of censorship,” from January to December 2023, 274 aggressions were registered against activists and independent journalists for reporting on social discontent among the Cuban population. Among the most common reprisals by the government are arrests and suppression of Internet service. Jiménez says that arbitrary arrests are only one of the “infinite variants” applied by the authorities to intimidate reporters. He said that other common forms of harassment include the interception of private communications, surveillance, interrogation of close circles, unofficial summonses and threats of arrest. According to Jiménez, author of the books “La isla oculta” (2022) and “Aterrizar en el mundo” (2024), the Cuban government changed its actions towards the dissident press starting in 2015, with the arrival of the Internet on the island. “Before, if you raised your voice, you could not leave the country, they called it migratory regulation. That was my case, I didn’t have a passport. With the empowerment of the people and with the protests, the strategy to kick out journalists changed. Those who were not kicked out are in jail. There are very few left doing independent journalism.” Cuba has rejected criticism, including from the US government. In a publicationin social network X, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez said US officials are not concerned about the human rights of Cubans and that the United States has its own human rights violations. Harassment of the press in Nicaragua has been widely reported on numerous occasions. One of the most recent cases was that of the newspaper La Prensa, one of Nicaragua’s leading newspapers. On August 13, 2021, officers of the National Police occupied the building where it operated, after a raid in which its general manager, Juan Lorenzo Hollman Chamorro, was arrested and charged with the crime of money laundering. On March 24, 2022, Hollman Chamorro was found guilty and on April 1 he was sentenced to 9 years in prison. Other members of the Chamorro family were also arrested and charged with various crimes. In 2022, the government expropriated the building where La Prensa had its newsroom and printing press; today the publication is only published online. The government also forced the closure of the television channel “100% Noticias”, owned by Carlos Fernando Chamorro, who went into exile in Costa Rica, from where he continues to publish digital newspaper El Confidencial. Nicaragua no longer has a print newspaper. According to the US State Department’s human rights report on NIcaragua,the government has outlawed more than 300 civil society organizations in 2023, bringing the number of closures to more than 3,500; stripped “more than 300 people of their citizenship and is holding more than 100 political prisoners in appalling conditions.” Between April and June 2023, about 23 journalists left Nicaragua due to harassment, threats of imprisonment and assaults mostly by police agents,according to a report by the Regional Network “Voces del Sur”and the foundation for Freedom of Expression and Democracy. Nicaraguan Vice President and government spokeswomanRosario Murillo publicly statedthat she was unaware of the State Department report but lashed out at Washington.  “We respond to their list of slanders, defamations and infamies by attributing them to themselves… provocateurs, aggressors, invaders and directors of choirs and orchestras made up of their local servitude. We denounce them once again as the most barbarous and savage violators of all human rights.” Gerall Chávez used to work at the country’s Vos TV channel. In 2018, he decided to leave Nicaragua following the arrest of two colleagues and after receiving information that he was going to be arrested. Since then, he has been living as in Costa Rica, where he and his family continues to receive intimidating messages. Chavez told CNN thatthe few independent media that remain in Nicaragua have largely “stopped reporting” to avoid reprisals. Today, he added, “there is an information blackout.” “Doing journalism in Venezuela implies a daily effort to overcome the censorship mechanisms that have been consolidated in the country,” Edgar López, a Venezuelan journalist, told CNN en Español. “In Venezuela, secrecy is state policy. State agencies do not provide information on matters of public interest, and, in addition, they expect the media and journalists to limit themselves to disseminating official narratives without any questioning,” he said. “The government leadership perceives the independent press as an internal enemy. This has resulted in the consolidation of aggression patterns that range from stigmatizing discourse to physical aggressions, which tend to increase in electoral contexts such as the current one,” said López. According to the State Department human rights report, “national and international groups condemned (President Nicolas) Maduro’s efforts throughout the year to restrict freedom of the press and create a climate of fear and self-censorship”. The report notesthat “the National College of Journalists estimated that close to 4,000 journalists emigrated from the country due to threats in the last 20 years”. In January 2024,the State Department also reportedthat 33 Venezuelans are facing arrest warrants or have been detained by Venezuelan authorities for political reasons, among them several journalists. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil responded in X that the United States was “displaying its cynicism once again, preparing a report on human rights that it insists on filling with lies and falsehoods against Venezuela. Without any morals, the most hostile and deadly empire of humanity dares to talk about rights that they constantly violate and belittle”. On January 9, 2024, a group of hooded men stormed a live news program on TC Television in Guayaquil. For several hours, the criminals held journalists and channel staff hostage in a high-tension situation that was partially televised. Hours later, after the hostages were released, several people were arrested. “The security context that the country is experiencing is regrettable and at the same time generates repercussions against communication workers, who have become a key part to unveil the acts of corruption that are known today,” Jeannine Cruz, president of the Communication Council of Ecuador, told CNN. “One of the repercussions that this problem has caused is exiles,” she added. With political polarization across Latin America, countries across the region can shift radically from left to right depending on the president in power. But across the spectrum, many of the region’s current leaders seem to show a hostility toward journalism – particularly on social media. Both the far-right Milei in Argentina and leftist Colombian leader Gustavo Petro have used their social networks to attack journalists and independent media, for example. And the government of El Salvador’s popular President Nayib Bukele has been criticized by local journalists for penalizing publication of information about the country’s gangs. All part of a dangerous erosion of one of the region’s fundamental pillars of democracy – the same democracy that brought these leaders, at least temporarily, to the most powerful seats in their countries.

            "Gatherings of people across north and central Gaza on Wednesday expressed gratitude tostudents on US college campuses who have been protesting the war in Gaza. In Deir al-Balah, in front of Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital, doctors, nurses, and medical staff held signs with messages that included “United against genocide,” “The killing of children must stop,” and “Keep on fighting for justice.” Dr. Saad Abu Sharban told CNN he was “over the moon” at images of protesters in other countries, because it meant “that around the world there are human beings who know what is happening here in Gaza Strip right now.” Palestinians in Gaza have been showing support for the US protestersfor several days. In several refugee camps in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, children could also be seen holding signs and banners with the names of different American universities where pro-Palestinian demonstrations have been held, saying “thanks for your solidarity!” Nadia Al-Dibs, a mother whose children were holding banners behind her in Deir al-Balah, told CNN she felt grateful to the “brave students” at American universities for their solidarity with Gaza and for calling for a ceasefire. “Arab populations haven’t cared about us, while students at American universities have felt with us, have felt the blood that spills from us, our buildings that get struck and our kids whose lives get destroyed … a thousand thanks to them,” she said. The public appreciation from people in Gaza come amid growing controversy in the US over the campus demonstrations, which have spread across the country in recent weeks amid mounting tensions over Israel’s war on Hamas, launched after the terror group’s October 7 attack that left more than 1,200 dead. The protests in the US are broadly aimed at demanding an end to Israel’s devastating assault in the Palestinian enclave, which has killedmore than 34,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry, and is nearing its eighth month. But critics say some demonstrations have crossed the line into anti-semitism. Israel has claimed the protests are being manipulated by “outside agitators.” Israel’s UN Ambassador Gilad Erdan denounced the university demonstrations in a speech to the General Assembly in New York on Wednesday. Erdan accused the demonstrations of being made up of “antisemitic protesters affiliated with outside agitators.” He said the students should face expulsion, while university professors and presidents should face “swift and severe action.” The speech in the General Assembly followed a Security Council vote last month on a resolution that would have recognized a Palestinian state. That vote wasvetoed by the US. Erdan lashed out at his UN colleagues, accusing the General Assembly of spreading anti-Israel rhetoric which he claimed had helped galvanize the protesters. He yelled “shame” toward the countries seated in the hall. Several colleges have recently hardened their stance by calling in law enforcement to clear their campuses – a crackdown hailed byformer US President Donald Trumpas “a beautiful thing to watch” at Columbia University in New York. Meanwhile, Shiraz university in Iran’s Fars province has offered scholarships to students from universities in the US and Europe who are expelled over the protests.

            "Dozens of Palestinian children eagerly lined up for a meal in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, as aid workers unloaded huge saucepans of stew and rice from parked trucks under the bright sun. CNN footage from the distribution site in front of a sprawling displacement shelter showed staffers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK) serving the children on Wednesday. More kids peered from high balconies where clothes draped over washing lines. Palestinian mother Um Hassan told CNN her toddler was grateful to receive the plate of hot rice; their family had been surviving on canned food for weeks. The World Central Kitchen, a US-based non-profit that focuses on fighting hunger around the world, resumed work in Gaza this week, after a hiatus following a series of Israelimilitary strikesthat killed seven staffers in April and drew the world’s condemnation. Israeli forceshave previously taken responsibilityfor the deaths, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering rare public acknowledgment and a promise to investigate the “tragic incident.” World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres wrote on Wednesday that returning to Gaza after losing his staff was not easy, but that the organization could not “stand by” as people in Gaza suffered. “The decision… to restart feeding in Gaza is both the hardest and the simplest one we could make,” Andres wrote on X. “Hard, because only a month has passed since seven of our WCK colleagues were killed in an IDF attack. These humanitarian heroes risked everything to feed people they did not know and would never meet. And yet simple, because the need is so great. We cannot stand by while so many people are so desperate for the essentials of life.” Human rights agencies have long warned of a spiraling humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza under Israel’s military’s seven-month assault, launched in response tothe Hamas-led October 7 terror attacks. More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza as of May 1, according to the local ministry of health. Over the course of the war, more than 1.9 million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced, according to the UN, with many sheltering in crammed tent camps that cannot offer enough access to sanitation or food. The entire population of more than 2.2 million people is now at riskof famine, and at least 30 children have already died of malnutrition and dehydration in Gaza, according to the health ministry. A local WCK staffer, Ashraf Al Sultan, told CNN on Wednesday that people in the Deir al-Balah shelter were clearly struggling. “Since yesterday after we resumed working, we could see people’s desperation. People have no food, and we’ve all been displaced,” he said. “[The World Central Kitchen’s] food makes people feel that they are at home. It is decent food, it is clean. They also treat people well.” “I haven’t received a hot meal for a month because the kitchen team was struck. We only had canned food,” Zaki Sobeh, a young boy at the displacement site, told CNN after receiving his plate of food on Wednesday. “I say thank you and may God protect them.” Human rights organizations have repeatedlywarned thatIsrael’s strict limitations on passage into Gaza is diminishing critical supplies and drastically hindering relief efforts within the Palestinian territory. In March, the United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk,warnedIsrael’s sustained restrictions on aid into Gaza may amount to the war crime of starvation. Israel says there is“no limit”on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on aid trucks has meant that only a tiny fraction of the amount of food and other supplies that used to enter Gaza daily before the war is getting in now. Shortly after the deaths of the World Central Kitchen workers in April, Israeli officials agreed to open the Erez border crossing into northern Gaza to allow aid deliveries. Food shortages have been the worst there after Israel concentrated its military offensive there in the early days of the war. On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant described the opening of Erez as “essential” to “increase the volume of humanitarian aid into Gaza.” But efforts to increase aid have also run into repeated trouble. At least 48 aid trucks were blocked on Wednesday after Israeli settlers attacked a aid convoy en route to Gaza via the southern Kerem Shalom crossing, according to Jordanian authorities. The US State Department also said Thursday that a delivery of aid that passed through Erez crossing earlier in the week had been temporarily intercepted by Hamas, which controls the isolated enclave, before being retrieved by the United Nations.

A vehicle, tents, and a cell phone were found during an ongoing search in the area where the men were last seen, according to Mexican authorities. American Jack Carter Rhoad and Australian brothers Jake and Callum Robinson were reported missing on April 29, according to the Baja California prosecutor’s office. The three friends are believed to have been on a surfing and camping trip near the municipality of Ensenada, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of Tijuana. “At this moment a team of investigators is in the location where it seems they were seen for the last time, where tents were found along with some evidence that could be related to these three people included in the investigation,” Baja California’s chief public prosecutor Maria Elena Andrade Ramirez told a news conference Thursday. Three Mexican nationals were being questioned in connection with the case, she said, though it is unclear if they are suspects.Baja Californiahas been plagued by cartel violence in recent years, though it rarely occurs in tourist areas like Ensenada. In social media posts, the mother of the missing Australians said the three friends have been unreachable since April 27 after they failed to show up at an Airbnb in the nearby coastal resort of Rosarito. She also raised concern about Callum’s diabetes and appealed for anyone with information to come forward. “Australian friends Jake and Callum Robinson have gone missing around Rosarita/Ensenada region of Baja California Norte Saturday morning,” Debra Robinson posted on Instagram alongside a photo of her two sons. “They were likely surfing. Callum is diabetic—this is a very dire situation.” The brothers are from Perth, WesternAustralia, according to CNN affiliate Seven News. Jake, 30, is a doctor, while Callum, 33, lives in San Diego, California and is a member of Australia’s national lacrosse team, the Seven report said. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expressed concern over the brothers’ disappearance. “We certainly hope that these brothers are found safely, but there is real concern about the fact that they’ve gone missing,” he told Seven. “Their mother is obviously very distressed about this.

            "Renewed eruptions from aremote Indonesian volcanohave triggered fresh evacuation orders and sparked flight cancellations and airport closures this week with smoke, lava and volcanic gasses spewing out of the fiery mountain. Mount Ruang, a 725-meter (2,400-foot) volcano on Ruang Island, North Sulawesi, has been erupting in spectacular fashion on and offsince mid-April, posing a growing threat to those living nearby and to air traffic in the region. The volcano erupted three times on Tuesday, sending lava and ash clouds into the sky and prompting Indonesia’s national PVMBG volcanology agency to issue its highest alert, warning that a tsunami could be triggered by “volcanic material collapsing into the ocean.” Ruang lies just off the coast of the larger Tagulandang island, where authorities have called on more than12,000 people to evacuate, according to Reuters. Footage released by the National Disaster Management Authority (BNPB) on Thursday showed huge crowds of people awaiting evacuation at ports and towering ash plumes. PVMBG raised alert levels on Tuesday, warning of “new eruptions and continuous earthquakes” while advising the public to wear protective masks and exercise caution. The latest eruptions have also forced closures of at least seven airports in the vicinity, including the Sam Ratulangi International Airport that serves the city of Manado, capital of North Sulawesi province and a well-known scuba diving destination. Nearby schools have also been shut to protect children from volcanic ash, BNPB said. Dramatic footage shared by the BNPB on Thursday showed ash cascading into the air. Mount Ruang is a stratovolcano, which are typically conical and relatively steep-sided due to the formation of viscous, sticky lava that does not flow easily. Stratovolcanoes often produce explosive eruptions due to gas build-up in the magma, according to volcanologists. Volcanic ash from Ruang has reached eastern Malaysian airspace, Malaysia’s meteorological department said. “We are monitoring the volcanic dust movements continuously and will update the information and issue aviation weather warnings if necessary,” said Met Malaysia chief Muhammad Helmi Abdullah Regional carrier Air Asia said it canceled 21 flights following Mount Ruang’s latest eruption. “Guests traveling to and from affected destinations (between Malaysia and Indonesia) are encouraged to check their email and phones for cancelation notifications,” the airline said Wednesday. “Air Asia is continuing to monitor the situation closely and will provide more information on the latest developments.” Malaysia’s national carrier Malaysia Airlines also issued similar travel advisories on Wednesday, following the cancelation of several flights in the area. Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of 270 million people, sits along the Ring of Fire and has more than 120 active volcanoes – more than anywhere else in the world. Mount Ruang previously erupted in April, disrupting more than 200 flights on April 18 and 19 and affecting tens of thousands of passengers, officials said. Hundreds living in the volcano’s vicinity were evacuated due to fears it could partially collapse into the sea and cause a tsunami as it did in 1871.\n",

            "China launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country’s ambitious space program. The Chang’e-6 probe –China’smost complex robotic lunar mission to date – blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China’s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country’s National Space Administration said the launch was a success. The launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China’s push to become adominant space powerwith plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole. It comes as a growing number of countries,including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field. China’s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang’e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon’s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon’s far side during its 2019 Chang’e-4 mission. Any far-side samples retrieved by the Chang’e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself – and provide important data to advance China’s lunar ambitions. “The Chang’e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon’s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,” Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration’s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site. The Chang’e-6 probe will be a key test for China’s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping’s “eternal dream” of building the country into a space power. China has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia. With the Chang’e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its ownorbital space station, the Tiangong. The technically complex Chang’e-6 mission builds on both the Chang’e-4’s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang’e-5’s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples. This time, to communicate with Earth from the moon’s far side, Chang’e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March. The probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module. The mission plan is for the Chang’e-6’s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago. An ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission’s return to Earth. The complex mission “goes through virtually every step” that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who hascollaborated withChinese scientists leading the mission. In addition to returning samples that could yield “fundamental new insights into the origin and early history of the moon and solar system,” the mission also serves as “robotic practice for these steps” to get astronauts to the moon and back, he said. China plans to launchtwo more missionsin the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon before building a research station in the following decade on the lunar south pole – a region believed to contain water ice. Chang’e-7, scheduled for 2026, will aim to search for resources on the moon’s south pole, while Chang’e-8 roughly two years later could look at how to utilize lunar materials to prepare for building the research base, Chinese officials have said. Friday’s launch comes as multiple nations ramp up their lunar programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and further deep space exploration access that successful moon missions could bring. Last year,India landedits first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia’s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when itsLuna 25 probe crashedinto the moon’s surface. In January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though itsMoon Sniper landerfaced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, aNASA-funded missiondesigned by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole. That landing – the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades – is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts thereas soon as 2026and build its scientific base camp. NASA administrator Bill Nelson last month appeared to acknowledge that China’s pace – and concerns about its intentions – were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions. “We believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. I think in effect we are in a race,” Nelsontoldlawmakers last month, adding his concern that China could try to bar the US or other countries from certain lunar areas if they arrive there first. China has long said it stands for the peaceful use of space, and, like the US, has looked to use its space prowess to cultivate international goodwill. This time, China has said the Chang’e-6 mission carries scientific instruments or payloads from France, Italy, Pakistan and the European Space Agency. “China hopes to strengthen cooperation with its international counterparts and deepen international cooperation in the space field,” Ge of the CNSA told reporters a day ahead of the launch.

Authorities were still in the process of notifying the person’s next of kin, according to spokesperson Becky Ryan, who didn’t disclose any more information about the storm victim in a phone call with CNN. The tornado hit Westmoreland, which has about740 residents, at about 4:50 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. The three injured didn’t need to be admitted to a hospital, Ryan said at a news conference. The tornado “took the north – you know, half of the town,” Pottawatomie County Sheriff Shane Jager said. Twenty-two houses were destroyed or are unlivable, and 13 other homes and one business were damaged, Ryan said. Three RVs and some outbuildings also were destroyed, Ryan said. Damaged structures included Pottawatomie County administration buildings in Westmoreland. A curfew began Tuesday at 9:30 p.m., according to a news release.

            "Police launched an investigation Wednesday into the fire thattore through Copenhagen’s famous stock exchangebuilding, causing the collapse of its spire and damaging centuries-old artwork and architecture. The blaze was still burning on Wednesday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it began, and authorities and citizens in the Danish capital have started reckoning with the loss of one of the city’s most recognizable landmarks. Local firefighters continued to try to put out the fire, which ripped through the building – known locally as Børsen – from early Tuesday, reaching all its floors and causing the collapse of a dragon-tail spire that had long been a symbol of the city. The walls of the building are still standing, but the interior has been significantly damaged and the roof is partially collapsed. Firefighters used cranes to hose water down into the building. Copenhagen police meanwhile launched an investigation on Wednesday, which they said will be a “complicated process.” Police officer Brian Belling said authorities have already “conducted interviews, secured surveillance and carried out a large number of investigative steps.” “But of course, there is still a lot to do, especially as we have not yet had the opportunity to examine Børsen itself,” Belling added. The 17th century building exemplified the style of the Dutch Renaissance, and housed a number of artworks, some of which were saved on Tuesday. Residents were stunned by the outbreak, which brought back memories of the fire that tore through the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris exactly five years and a day earlier. “My first thought was (that) I hope that they rebuild it – it’s never going to be the same but it’s iconic to Copenhagen and Denmark,” teacher Eva Simoni Lomholdt, 58, told Reuters. Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce which owns the building, told the news agency that a firefighter gave him the top of the spire on Wednesday morning after it was recovered following its fall. “It gives me hope because we have decided to rebuild the stock exchange because it’s part of European history as a trading continent,” he said. The old stock exchange – located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg Palace – dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. It has been at the heart of Danish business since then; while it no longer houses the Danish stock exchange, it serves as the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday a “piece of Danish history” was on fire, calling the building “irreplaceable.” Denmark’s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt added that 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. “How touching it is to see how the employees at Børsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,” he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n",

            "The whir of the helicopter shakes the marquee tent’s roof and kicks up a plume of dust that swirls through the thronging crowd, announcing the arrival of the man they’ve all come to see. Chanting his name, waving his party’s flag and quoting his slogans, in many of their eyes he can do no wrong.Narendra Modi,India’shugely popular but deeply polarizing prime minister, has landed in the battleground state of Uttar Pradesh as he campaigns for athird consecutive termin power. Arrival at the rally in Aligarh, a three-hour drive from New Delhi, was preceded by a cacophony of horn-honking cars, motorcycles, and trucks all muscling their way in and out of traffic with few discernible lanes. Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state of 240 million people, is right in the heart of the nation’s “Hindi belt”, the predominantly Hindi-speaking Indian states where support for Modi and the devotion of his followers is especially strong. Win UP, so they say, and you win India. As the sun glares down on the dusty field in Aligarh and temperatures soar to 38 degrees Celsius (100 Fahrenheit), the crowd don’t seem to mind. “Modi! Modi! Modi!” they chant, as the prime minister speaks about the BrahMos – a nuclear-capable, land-attack cruise missile jointly developed by Russia and India – that will soon be assembled in a local factory. With nearly 970 million eligible voters, India’s ongoing weekslong election – the world’s largest democratic exercise – is seen as critical in shaping the South Asian country’s trajectory over the next five years, with Modi widely expected to win. And here in Uttar Pradesh, a sense of pride is evident among the thousands gathered to hear the prime minister speak. “We feel proud to have such kind of a leader,” says math teacher Pramod Charma. “Whatever he says, he does – that’s why he calls it ‘Modi’s guarantee.’ In politics, he is the biggest star right now. No one can replace him.” In many ways Modi is part of the wider global wave of populist leaders with an authoritarian streak that have amassed a fervent voter base in recent years. Modi projects himself as an outsider from humble origins. Born as the son of a tea seller in a small town in western Gujarat state, he does not fit neatly within the often privately educated, resolutely metropolitan, English-speaking template set by many previous Indian leaders. To his devoted followers, he’s a man who has transformed the lives of ordinary Indians with his welfare and social policies – while cementing India as a key power broker. But to his critics, he’s a divisive leader, whose Hindu nationalist ambitions have given rise to growing religious persecution andIslamophobia, with many of the country’s more than 200 million Muslims fearing his re-election. Just a day before this April 22 rally in Aligarh, Modi sparked a row over hate speech while campaigning in northwestern Rajasthan state when he accused Muslims – who have been present in India for centuries – of being “infiltrators.” He also echoed a false conspiracy voiced by some Hindu nationalists that Muslims are displacing the country’s majority Hindu population by deliberately having large families. That speech stirred widespread anger and calls for election authorities to investigate the comments. BJP spokespeople subsequently said Modi was talking about undocumented migrants. And Modi’s remarks did little to shake the faith of his devoted followers in Aligarh. Lawyer Gaurav Mahajan says this is the fifth Modi campaign rally he has attended. “(He is the) most powerful leader in the world,” he says. “Indians have faith in Modi.” With just two out of seven phases of voting complete, Indian politics remains unpredictable. But with no one in the opposition camp to possess the kind of brand name and star quality that Modi has, analysts say his re-election is widely expected. Opposition leaders have meanwhile accused Modi’s right-wing government of becoming an electoral autocracy by attempting to rig the vote, weaponizing state agencies to stifle, attack and arrest opposition politicians, and undermining democratic principles. They also warn that Modi’s brand of Hindu nationalism is uncorking dangerous religious divides in a country with a long and tragic history of sectarian bloodletting. The BJP’s national spokesperson has previously said the party is not prejudiced against Muslims and that democracy is protected under the constitution. Modi is expected to remain on the campaign trail until India’s next prime minister is named in early June, traversing the huge country, visiting city after city and delivering his roaring speeches that attract the masses. In Aligarh, the mood feels like a jovial pep rally, and there is none of the divisive rhetoric that was on show in Rajasthan. When the crowd spots our camera, as if on cue, they begin to chant: “Modi! Modi! Modi!” Old and young, the sentiment in the crowd appears universal. “There are no words to express the goodness of Modi,” says engineering student Narayan Pachaury, 17. “No one is bigger than him.”\n",

After thefuror over Kate’s recent Mother’s Day photo, which was found to have been digitally altered, the palace’s release process has adjusted. The new photo has not been verified by CNN. Kensington Palace appears to be reclaiming some of the control and narrative by only posting to social accounts on the day, aware that any lack of honesty or sense of inauthenticity will sparkall sorts of conspiracy theorieslike it did last time. It’s been a difficult start to 2024 for Britain’s royal family. Kate has been away from her public duties since Christmas and is currently undergoingtreatment for cancer. Princess Charlotte was last seen in public during the British royal family’s traditional Christmas Day walk to church on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The nine-year-old was also seen earlier in December alongside her parents and siblings at her mother annual carol concert at Westminster Abbey in London. At a visit to a school in the UK’s West Midlands last week, Charlotte’s father Prince William shared her favorite joke with students of St Michael’s Church of England High School - a “knock knock” gag involving an interrupting cow. Charlotte is third in line to the throne, after her father and older brother Prince George. And while she may be one of the younger members of the family, her mom revealed in 2017 that she is “the one in charge.” Royal-watchers may remember a clip of Charlotte at her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II’s state funeral in 2022, where she appeared to be reminding her elder brother George to bow as the late monarch’s coffin passed them at Wellington Arch. She was also spotted at a previous Trooping the Colour parade in London stopping her younger brother, Prince Louis, from waving perhaps a little too enthusiastically to the crowds as their carriage drove by. Meanwhile, the little royal won hearts last year with herregal twinning with her motherwhen the pair attended King Charles’ coronation. For her grandfather’s big day, Charlotte wore a mini-me version of her mom’s ivory silk dress and silver headpiece. Charlotte is the first British princess who wasn’t overtaken in the line of succession by a younger brother. That’s because her grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, changed the rules with theSuccession to the Crown Act of 2013so that all royal children born after 2011 would have an equal right to the throne regardless of gender. Two years later, Charlotte Elizabeth Diana was born on May 2, 2015 at St. Mary’s Hospital in west London. The change meant that did not lose her position in the line of succession after Prince Louis was born in 2018.\n",

            "It was late 2021 when James Richardson heard about England’s poop problem. “I saw a tweet talking about the extent of the problem, and the numbers were so enormous I thought it couldn’t be true – that there was so much sewage being dumped,” he says now. “I thought, ‘It’s social media, someone must be exaggerating.’ So I thought I’d look into it, because if it was true it’d be a scandal.” His research tallied with the tweet: raw sewage was being pumped into England’s rivers and onto beaches at a truly astonishing rate. So-called “storm overflows” – designed to flush overly full drains into rivers, seas and even across beaches – are supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances, as the name suggests. But in 2021, the year Richardson saw the data, they disgorged their contents across the country for a total of 2.7 million hours – equivalent to over 300 years. Over the past few years, members of the British public have seen beaches closed for swimming on peak summer holiday weekends, dead fish floating in busy rivers, and found themselves surfing effluent-engorged waves. “First it was the smell,” says Giles Bristow, who once found himself in the middle of a sewage slick when surfing in Staunton, Devon. “Then we saw toilet paper and sanitary products in the water. That was a real moment of, ‘Oh, god.’” Over the past few years, the UK’s “poopy beaches” problem has been sparking increasing anger from citizens around the country. Thecancelation of an annual swimming racein the Thames right before the current bank holiday weekend has also caused concern. The race, which has been held since the 1890s, was due to be held in July, but was called off because of fears of sewage in the water. 2022’s August Bank Holiday – a weekend when Brits flock to the beach – saw the closure of a beach in Brighton and Hove, a popular seaside escape for Londoners. “Brighton and Hove seem to be deluged over and over again,” Hugo Tagholm, the ex-CEO of campaign group Surfers Against Sewage (who has now been replaced by Bristow),told CNN at the time. This weekend is another bank holiday. But while Brighton and Hove beaches are safe to swim at, many others around the UK are not. According to Surfers Against Sewage’s live tracker, 12 out of 14 storm overflows on the Isle of Wight – a popular retreat off the southern coast – are currently emitting sewage. There’s a slew of currently operating overflows in popular vacation spot Devon, too – from ones near towns like Salcomb and Dawlish, to one on Sandy Bay, a beach that has in the past won Blue Flag status for its pristine waters. Despite widespread public outcry, the situation has been worsening. Graphs on Richardson’s website, the aptly namedTop of the Poops– which focuses on England – showed a slight downward trend from 2020 to 2022, before rising sharply in 2023. Sewage spills increased by 54% last year, according todata released in Marchby the Environment Agency – a UK government-founded public body established to “protect and improve” the environment. Back in 2021, Richardson, a software developer, was so horrified by what he saw that he launched his website to share the data in an accessible way – right down to the name, echoing a TV program from everyone’s childhood, “Top of the Pops.” Anyone wanting to see the spills in their area can search the data by water company, beach, river, shellfish-cultivation area, and – in bad news for politicians – constituency. “People can see what’s happening in their local area, and it really shows what a terrible problem we have,” says Richardson. “The numbers are too hard to keep in your mind – and it’s not getting any better. Afteroutrage in 2022– which included the UK’s chief medical officer labelling it a “growing public health problem” and the Environment Agency chair calling for CEOs of the offending water companies to be jailed – things have worsened. The annual “Event Duration Monitoring” (EDM) of storm overflows in England, released in March, said sewage spills had increased in 2023 by 54%. The average number of yearly spills per overflow had increased from 23 in 2022 to 33 – equivalent to more than one per fortnight. The total spills went from 301,091 to 464,056. Worse still, sewage spilled into UK waters for double the amount of time in 2023 that it did in 2022: a whopping 3.6 million hours, or the equivalent of over 400 years. There were fewer “well behaved” overflows, as well. Those that spilled fewer than 10 times in a year were down from 48% in 2022 to 40% in 2023. And those that didn’t spill at all went from 18% to 13.9%. Those overflows for “exceptional” circumstances have become all to common. The terse verdict from the Environment Agency? “Simply not good enough.” “It’s a total scandal,” says Giles Bristow, who is CEO of marine conservation charitySurfers Against Sewage. “Things have got massively worse – it’s a shocker.” A Surfers Against Sewagereportfound that 1,924 people fell ill after entering the UK’s waters between October 2022 and September 2023 – three times the number reported the previous year. The Liberal Democrats political party is campaigning forvictims to be compensatedby the water companies. Bristow attributes blame to “massive underinvestment by private water companies who’ve failed to do their duty.” UK water services were privatized in 1989. Richardson is particularly aggrieved because his provider, Thames Water, splits his bill into two portions. “One is for fresh water, the other – about half your bill – is for treating sewage,” he says. “So it’s shocking to find out that they’re essentially fly-tipping this stuff.” In 2021, Thames Water was fined £4 million (just under $5 million) for a 2016 incident in which it discharged an estimatedhalf-a-million liters of raw sewageinto streams near Richardson’s home, killing around 3,000 fish. The judge imposing the fine called it “disgraceful.” In November 2023, it was estimated that the company had poured at least72 billion liters of sewage into the Thames, England’s longest river, since 2020. Thames Water did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. Previously, the water company has said it is working to improve infrastructure to prevent future discharges. “It’s like paying for your recycling to be taken away and finding they’re just dumping it in the sea,” says Richardson. “We pay quite a lot for water in England. We’re not asking them to make the rivers better – just not to dump stuff in there.” Of course, sewage in the water is nothing new – and it’s not just a problem in the UK. For instance, in 2018, then-president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte closedBoracay island in the Philippines for almost six months, calling it a “cesspool” The US is no stranger to sewage spills, either. One closed the sands ofLong Beach, California, in 2022, and again in April 2023. Bristow – who still happily enters the water, but advises checking Surfers Against Sewage’sreal-time pollution-tracking appbefore doing so – calls water pollution “a global issue.” But he also says that many other countries are better at dealing with sewage – and monitoring it, too. In France, for example, the public can access daily updates about water quality in their area. “The UK has consistently bumped along the bottom of European tables [for water cleanliness],” he says. In 2020 (the last year that the UK was part of the EU), the country had thelowest quality bathing water in Europe, with just 17.2% of UK beaches rated as “excellent.” Compare that to Cyprus, where all beaches made the grade, or Greece, where 97.1% were ranked excellent. Compare it, too, to2022’s data, where – in lieu of the UK, which no longer figures in the statistics, since it’s no longer part of the EU – the lowest-rating country is Poland, with 55.9% of its beaches rated excellent for water quality. It’s not just the beaches. According to2019 data, just 14% of England’s rivers and lakes were classed as having “good ecological status.” In 2012, the European Commission took the UK to the European Court of Justice for breaching wastewater regulations. As Chris Whitty, then the UK’s chief medical officer, wrote inhis 2022 report, “Nobody wants a child to ingest human faeces.” “It’s vital we aren’t reclassified as ‘the dirty man of Europe,’” Hugo Tagholmtold CNNthat same summer. So how can things improve? The UK’s Victorian drainage system is often blamed for not being able to handle 21st-century levels of sewage. Adding to the pressure, rainwater runoff passes through the same pipes as wastewater from houses and offices. Add in increasingly extreme weather events thanks to the climate crisis, and you have a recipe for overflowing drains. And yet, that doesn’t quite explain the situation in the UK. According to research from the Royal Society of Chemistry, storm overflows should only enter use when sewers are atsix times their usual volume. Yet data from the UK’sMet Officeshows that 2021 and 2022 were actually drier than average years, and 2023 was only 11% wetter than average. Bristow wants “smarter,” climate-proof solutions for what looks set to be a wetter UK climate. In fact, forget just widening pipes – he wants to prevent rain from even making it as far as the drains. He suggests initiatives such as reforesting areas to hold back heavy rain, or introducing wetlands, as providing a “natural defense.” None of this will be quick. Surfers Against Sewage is campaigning for an end to discharges in bathing water and high-priority nature sites by 2030. Bristow says they’re in talks with all major political parties in the run up to the UK’s next General Election, which must take place before January 28, 2025. In the meantime, 2023 saw the governmentfitting monitors to all England’s storm overflows, so that data can at least be gathered. The government’s “Storm overflows discharge reduction plan,”published in 2022, sets targets for water companies to “reduce the impact of storm overflows” by 2050. “It’ll take time to turn the tank around, but the tide is turning,” says Bristow. “We should expect to see things turn around by 2030 if we’re making the right investment decisions now. The time to act is now or never.” That sounds like six more years of poopy beaches, but Bristow is adamant that nobody should put off a trip to the UK coastline because of the sewage problems. “We have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and hospitable communities,” he says. “Come and surf, enjoy our beaches and our breaks. But download the [Surfers Against Sewage] app, and know where to go in.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/style/rosalia-straitjacket-fashion/index.html\n",
            "On Tuesday, 12-time Latin Grammy winner Rosalía stepped out in New York wearing an outfit that demanded a double-take. The Spanish pop star wore a dainty white lace prairie dress and a pair of heel-less Rick Owens Cantilever boots, but the main event was shrugged over her shoulders. Her cream-colored canvas coat was punctuated by a series of black buckles and belts. Was it another vintage biker jacket? (Since the release of her third album, “Motomami,” Rosalía has been spotted in everything from biker-style shield sunglasses to Harley Davidson helmets). But upon further inspection her outerwear looked more medical than motorcycle. The elongated sleeves sewn shut and finished with another fastening buckle meant the singer’s hands were forced to burst through a side seam. Her coat resembled a straitjacket. First invented in the 18th-century, straitjackets were used as restraints in hospitals and asylums. Although they were intended to protect patients from harm, some practitioners regarded the physical binding inhumane, with many campaigning for an alternative treatment. By the counter-cultural movement of the 1960s, a wave of anti-psychiatry thinking broke out — criticizing not only practices such as restraint jackets and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), but mainstream medicine’s definition of mental illness altogether. Straitjackets and their misuse quickly became a cultural symbol of medical barbarism, in part due to films such as “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975). In 1994, theNew York State’s Officeof Mental Health proposed that straitjackets be discontinued after 18 patients died while restrained or in “unsupervised seclusion” between 1988 and 1992. While they are rarely used in modern establishments today, the image of a restraint jacket can still be a potent reminder of bygone asylums and mistreatment. But Rosalía isn’t the first to attempt to recontextualize the garment in the name of fashion. In 2019, Gucci sent a series of straitjacket-inspired jumpsuits down the runway at Milan Fashion Week. In a white warehouse, 20 models stood still on a green conveyor belt — each bound by an all-white ensemble, many of which featured buckles and straps. One model in the line-up, Ayesha Tan-Jones, used the runway to stage a silent protest of the looks — writing on their hands “Mental health is not fashion.” On Instagram, Tan-Joneswrote after the show: “Straitjackets are a symbol of a cruel time in medicine when mental illness was not understood, and people’s rights and liberties were taken away from them, while they were abused and tortured in the institution.” “Many of the other Gucci models who were in the show felt just as strongly as I did about this depiction of straitjackets, and without their support I would not have had the courage to walk out (on the runway) and peacefully protest,” they said. The straitjackets only made up half of Gucci’s collection, as the conveyor belt-turned-catwalk was suddenly flooded with colorful clothes more typical of then creative director Alessandro Michele’s style. The brand responded to criticismstatingthat the “blank-styled clothes represented how through fashion, power is exercised over life, to eliminate self-expression. This power prescribes social norms, classifying and curbing identity.” The luxury fashion house also clarified that the straitjacket-style jumpsuits would not be for sale. In contrast, Rosalía’s outfit has barely raised an eyebrow. The musician has built a reputation as a sartorial risk-taker, often mixing flamenco influences with on-trend biker chic. And while her outfit has made headlines, it hasn’t caused a debate, perhaps due to the increasing prevalence of shocking ensembles out there. Since the rise of Julia Fox in 2021, we’ve seen dresses made from coat hangers, garbage bags and saran wrap. Last September,Ye’s wife Bianca Censoriwas pictured in Florence, Italy wearing nothing but a purple pillowcase. Fashion houses previously at the center of public criticism have also risen from the ashes. John Galliano —convicted of hate crimesand fired from Dior in 2011 — has been reputationally resurrected with alandmark showat Maison Margiela and the release of anew documentary. Similarly, Dolce & Gabbana have rebuilt an impressive celebrity roster after a series of promotional videos advertising their Shanghai show were accused of beingracist in 2018. (The brand later released an official press statement that said the event and videos were “created especially with love and passion for China and all the people around the world who loves Dolce & Gabbana.”) Is Rosalia making a social statement with her straitjacket-style outerwear, or merely using what was once considered shocking for a street style snap? What is certain is that, in 2024, fashion is a lot more comfortable blurring those boundaries.\n",

Thousands of civilians and hundreds of troops from Myanmar have crossed the border to India after the coup. This has worried New Delhi, which has announced plans tofence its borderwith Myanmar and end a visa-free movement policy. At least 38 refugees were deported on Thursday by the border state of Manipur, which plans to send back a total of 77 people as it copes withsporadic violencethat has killed at least 220 people since ethnic clashes broke out in May last year. “Without any discrimination, we have completed the first phase of deportation of illegal immigrants from Myanmar,” Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh said in a social media post. “The state government is continuing the identification of illegal immigrants.” One Indian national was also repatriated by Myanmar, Singh added. New Delhi has not signed the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which spells out refugee rights and states’ responsibilities to protect them, and it does not have its own laws protecting refugees. Singh, who is from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, said in March deportations had begun, but Indian security officials said the efforts wereheld upby fighting in Myanmar.

            "Archaeologistshave unearthed the skeletons of five people, missing their hands and feet, at a formerNazimilitary base in Poland. They were discovered at a Nazi command center known as theWolf’s Lairin Gierloz, northeastern Poland, after the group unearthed a fragment of human skull during a dig on February 24 and alerted local authorities, who decided to carry out further excavations. The remains belonged to three adults, a teenager and a newborn baby, according to a statement from the Latebra Foundation, a historical organization based in the Polish city of Gdansk, published Thursday. The five bodies were arranged near each other, facing in the same direction, outside a houseoccupied by Nazi commanderHermann Göring, an ace fighter pilot during World War I who became one of the most powerful Nazi leaders in World War II and a close friend of Adolf Hitler. Alongside them were burned boards and the remains of sewage infrastructure, but there were no traces of clothing, according to the statement. Adrian Kostrzewa, a member of the foundation’s board of directors, told CNN that the team initially thought they were digging up an old bathroom when they found pipes under the ground. However, they then found ashes and a burned key, before he found the skull fragment. “It was very surprising,” he said. The foundation is waiting to hear the results of a police investigation into the remains, and many questions remain unanswered. “There are many theories (about) why they do not have hands and feet,” said Kostrzewa. “Right now, it’s very hard to say.” An important next step is to find out the age of the remains using radio carbon dating, he added. Deliberately built miles from civilization in the forests of northeastern Poland, the Wolf’s Lair was the Nazis’ 6.5-square-kilometer (2.5-square-mile) Eastern Front headquarters. The base was one of the largest of its kind in Europe, according to the foundation. “The uniqueness of this discovery lies in the fact that the bodies were found on the premises of the most heavily guarded complex of the Third Reich,” the statement reads. Hitler spent nearly three years there in total. The fortress was the site of Operation Valkyrie, an assassination attempt against Hitler in July 1944, before it was destroyed in January 1945 to prevent it from falling into the hands of the advancing Soviet army, according to the foundation.\n",

            "Ukraine launched drone attacks on Russia’s Kushchevsk military airfield in the southern Krasnodar region, as well as two oil refineries, a source with knowledge of the operation told CNN. The source dubbed the operation “explosive,” and said that fires broke out at the three locations. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) “continues to effectively hit military and infrastructure facilities” in Russia, the source said, in a bid to reduce Moscow’s “potential for warfare.” The governor of Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev, had earlier said a Russian oil refinery was impacted after Kyiv launched drones in the early hours of Saturday morning. Russian state media outlet TASS reported that the oil refinery in Slavyansk-on-Kuban had partially suspended operations, citing Eduard Trudnev, security director for the Slavyansk ECO Group, which runs the facility. Trudnev said work at the plant had been “partially suspended” after 10 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) flew into the refinery, causing a fire to break out. “The presence of hidden damage is possible,” said Trudnev. Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Saturday that Kyiv had launched 66 drones to attack the Krasnodar region, but all were intercepted. Kondratyev said there were no casualties due to the Slavyansk refinery fire. Meanwhile in Ukraine, four thermal energy plants were “severely damaged” after Russian attacks overnight, according to a statement from DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company. The DTEK statement added that “at this moment, power engineers are trying to eliminate the consequences of the attack.” Ukraine’s Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko posted on Facebook that “facilities in Dnipropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv regions were attacked.” A power engineer at one of the facilities suffered a concussion, Halushchenko said. Serhii Lysak, head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said in an update on Telegram that the region had experienced a “massive attack.” Although air defenses intercepted 13 missiles in Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih and Pavlohrad districts, energy facilities were damaged in Dnipro and Kryvyi Rih districts, triggering fires and injuring a 39-year-old man. Lysak also said there were “interruptions in the water supply in the Kryvyi Rih district.” Svitlana Onyshchuk, head of the Ivano-Frankivsk regional military administration, said on Telegram on Saturday that a “critical infrastructure facility” in the Carpathian region was struck, causing a fire that has since been put out. DTEK said that its thermal power plants have been attacked more than 170 times since the beginning of the war. Mykola Oleshchuk, Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, said on Saturday that Russia had attacked Ukraine overnight with “34 air-, land-, and sea-launched missiles,” with 21 of those missiles intercepted. Commenting on the barrage of missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said “we managed to intercept a portion of them” but emphasized that “the world has all of the resources to assist us in intercepting every missile and drone.” In a post on X, he continued: “What Ukraine needs is air defense systems, a sufficient quantity and quality of weapons to ensure our frontline actions, as well as prompt delivery and steadfast action.” Ukraine has repeatedly said it urgently needs vital munitions, including air defense and artillery ammunition. US President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed into law an aid packageproviding crucial military assistanceto Ukraine, capping months of negotiations and debate. Passed by the Senate late Tuesday, the packageincludesnearly $61 billion in aid to Ukraine. On Friday, patients at two Kyiv hospitals were evacuated after Belarus claimed soldiers were sheltering within, prompting fears in Ukraine of a possible attack on the facilities. A video surfaced online showing the head of the Belarusian KGB security service alleging the two medical facilities were housing soldiers. Belarusian KGB head Ivan Tertel claimed during a speech on Thursday that Ukrainian fighters were “hiding behind the backs of children,” and provided the addresses of the two hospitals located in northeast Kyiv. One of them is a children’s hospital. “The enemy has practically announced its strike” and “even named the addresses,” Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in response, calling it “a provocation used as a pretext for a strike on our social critical infrastructure.” Fears of a potential attack prompted authorities urgently to start moving patients to other medical facilities in the Ukrainian capital. “This is an absolute lie and provocation of the enemy” aimed to justify strikes at the social infrastructure of the capital, the Kyiv city administration said in a statement. Videos shared online showed medical personnel hurrying to move patients and equipment to ambulances that were awaiting to receive them. By Friday evening, all patients were successfully moved to other medical facilities, Klitschko said, thanking the doctors, technical staff and ambulance workers for their “prompt and well-coordinated work.” The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) also denounced the claim that soldiers were based at the hospitals, calling it “a manifestation of information and psychological special operations that play into the hands of Russia.” Ukrainian authorities are yet to say whether the urgent transfer has resulted in complications for any of the patients.\n",

            "Japan’s “Moon Sniper” lander has defied the odds for a third time, surviving yet another long, frigid lunar night despite not being designed to endure such harsh conditions, according to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Temperatures during the lunar night can plunge to minus 208 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 133 degrees Celsius), according to NASA. And Moon Sniper wasn’t expected to withstand even one lunar night, which is a period of darkness on the moon lasting about two weeks. The robotic vehicle, also known as SLIM, or the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon, initially touched down on the lunar surface on January 19. The historic feat made Japan the third country this century, and the fifth ever, to land on the moon. The spacecraft touched down nearthe Shioli Crater, located about 200 miles (322 kilometers) south of the Sea of Tranquility, a region near the lunar equator, where Apollo 11 first landed humans on the moon. But things didn’t quite go according to plan. During descent, the spacecraft experienced an anomaly and landed on its nose, which meant its solar panels were facing west rather than upright and not receiving necessary sunlight to generate power. The lander had just enough energy to send back a mosaic of images before shutting down. The mission’s team in Japan remained hopeful that once sunlight could reach the solar panels again, the spacecraft might reawaken. So far, Moon Sniper, which gained its nickname for the precision technology that allowed it to land about 55 meters (180 feet) from its target, keeps pleasantly surprising the team bywaking up after each lunar night, taking new photos and transmitting them back before it goes back to sleep. The vehicle’s resilience in the face of lunar extremes is unique among missions that have landed on the moon in the past year, and experts have a couple ideas as to why that might be. The mission team communicated with Moon Sniper on April 23 after the lander rode out its third lunar night. The spacecraft was able to transmit more images of its landing site. “SLIM has maintained main functionality even after 3 nights on the Moon, which was not anticipated in the design!” the team shared onX, formerly known as Twitter. In addition to surviving the extreme cold of the lunar night, Moon Sniper has also endured the searing temperatures of the lunar day, which can reach 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius), according to NASA. The team shared that it’s closely monitoring SLIM’s condition in order to identify what components of the spacecraft could deteriorate over time as it experiences more of the lunar day and night environment. JAXA engineers have been careful about how they communicate with SLIM when it first wakes up since the spacecraft is operating in such high temperatures, which could heat up the cameras and damage them. As a result, the mission team usually waits about a day after SLIM wakes up before commanding it to send back images. So far, one of SLIM’s navigation cameras and the spacecraft’s Star Tracker have provided images from Moon Sniper’s experience on the lunar surface. The Star Tracker isn’t a true camera and instead was used to measure the direction of the spacecraft by tracking the alignment of the stars as the lander traveled to the moon. But the team has taken clever measures to make the most of Moon Sniper’s wonky landing. “It was not originally planned to be used on the lunar surface, but in principle it can take pictures just like a camera, which led to its operation through ‘secret commands,’” the agency shared on X. The spacecraft has two navigation cameras mounted in different directions. Given how Moon Sniper landed, one of those cameras is facing into space, but the other has a view of the landing site from the spacecraft’s perspective. The sun has once again set near Shioli Crater, and Moon Sniper went into hibernation again on April 29, according to the agency. “We plan to attempt to resume operation again in mid to late May, when SLIM’s solar cells start generating electricity. We appreciate your continued support,” the agency shared on X as Moon Sniper went to sleep once more. Members of the mission team recently composed a song in honor of Moon Sniper’s inspiring journey that they call “15 Degree Slope.” The song encompasses every step of the surprising mission, from launching and traveling to the moon to the unexpected landing and “the awakening of resurrection,” team members shared on X. The song borrows its name from the steep slope where Moon Sniper was intended to land. Now, the mission team believes the slope Moon Sniper landed on was about 10 degrees, which is still “surprisingly steep.” In February, Houston-based space exploration company Intuitive Machines landed its uncrewed IM-1 mission, also known as Odysseus, at the lunar south pole, making it thefirst commercial spacecraft ever to soft-land on the moonand the first US-made vehicle to reach the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972. But like SLIM, the “Odie” mission experienced a bit of a lunar rollercoaster ride that included having to rely on experimental technology to touch down and ultimately landing on its side. On February 29, after seven days of operating, Odie went to sleep because it wasn’t intended to survive the lunar night. The Intuitive Machines team listened out in case Odie awakened in March, but the spacecraft never phoned home again. “Odie was designed to only support his payloads, none of which were capable of lunar night, so we did not design him for more,” said Jack Fischer, former NASA astronaut and vice president of production and operations at Intuitive Machines. “There are measures we could have taken to allow for potentially lasting longer, but we were focused on economical, rapidly flown support of our payloads, as opposed to a nation-state sponsored mission.” The fact that Odie landed near the moon’s south pole, while SLIM touched down near the equator, could affect survivability of the lunar night, Fischer said. “It still depends on terrain, but the equator will generally have less issues with shadows and have more productive solar power generation (due to higher incidence angles) than Odie experienced at the South Pole,” he said. Other factors that could increase survivability include keeping a chemical battery protected and working through extreme temperatures and a design that can feed solar power directly to the power system, both of which could be implemented in the future. “Surviving the night is critical for any effort to build meaningful infrastructure on the Moon, and IM is working on a host of options with experiments as soon as our IM-3 mission,” Fischer said. “Our goal is to first ‘survive’ the night where the spacecraft goes into a sort of hibernation (like SLIM has done) and wakes up on the other side. Ultimately, we want to ‘thrive’ through the night, and are doing just that with our Lunar Terrain Vehicle program, where the vehicle can do meaningful work through the lunar night.” Fischer offered a tip of his cap to JAXA on the continued success of its mission. “While I’m not an expert on the design of their vehicle, it is quite a feat for their spacecraft to have survived three lunar nights, no matter the circumstances,” Fischer said. Japan’s success with Moon Sniper is just one entry into a renewed race to land on the moon that has played out over the past few years. India became the fourth country to land a robotic mission on the moon in August 2023 when theChandrayaan-3 mission touched downnear the lunar south pole. The Vikram lander and the Pragyan six-wheeled rover it deployed studied the moon for nearly two weeks before shutting down to sleep through the lunar night — butattempts to reawaken them were unsuccessful. And the push for lunar exploration continues as China seeks to land a sample-collecting mission on the moon’s far side, or the side facing away from Earth, and NASA aims to establish a sustained human presence at the lunar south pole through its ambitious Artemis program. The continued success of Moon Sniper comes during what Noah Petro, NASA project scientist for both the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Artemis III, calls a “great new era of lunar exploration.” Six of the groundbreaking Apollo missions returned lunar samples from different landing sites on the moon, but all of them were on the near side of the moon. Exploring new lunar regions provides new windows into understanding Earth’s satellite. “For me, there is great joy in seeing missions land on the lunar surface,” Petro said. “Every time we land on the surface, we learn more about this unique lunar environment that we’re getting ourselves into. Building up this database of lunar knowledge of what it means to be and work on the surface of the moon helps us be better prepared for the Artemis missions.”\n",

            "A huge fire has engulfed Copenhagen’s old stock exchange, one of the Danish capital’s most famous landmarks, causing its spire to collapse as staff and citizens scrambled to rescue paintings and historic artefacts from the blaze. “I cannot describe how upset I and my colleagues are,” said a visibly moved Brian Mikkelsen, CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, which owns and has offices in the 17th century building. “It is a huge disaster, because it is 400 years of cultural history that is in flames.” Stunned commuters and onlookers watched as the raging fire could be seen swirling around the building’s distinctive 56-meter spire - shaped as the tail of four entwined dragons - moments before it collapsed and fell into the street below. Some passersby even joined emergency services to run inside the burning building and help carry large Renaissance paintings and other objects away from the blaze. Among the paintings saved was Danish artist Peder Severin Krøyer’s 1895 work “From the Copenhagen Stock Exchange,” the Chamber of Commerce said. Denmark’s Deputy Prime Minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, called the fire “our own Notre Dame moment,” referring to the blaze that destroyed the roof and spire of the Paris cathedral, five years ago almost to the day. The fire began at around 8.30 a.m. local time (2.30 a.m. ET), a Copenhagen fire department chief told CNN, and by 11 a.m. nearly half of the building had been destroyed. The fire was still burning by late afternoon. The Chamber of Commerce said it is “at a loss for words for how great a tragedy this is.” It said it was “a sad day for our country” and that “the damage will unfortunately be very expensive.” “We have tried to rescue a lot of historic paintings that were inside the building and the historic furniture,” Jakob Vedsted Andersen, an executive director at the Greater Copenhagen fire and rescue service, told CNN. He said it was “way too soon” to speculate about the causes of the blaze. Copenhagen police have told people to avoid the area and there have been no reported injuries so far. People were in the building when the fire started but they were all evacuated, said a police spokesperson who added that military personnel were at the scene to support fire-fighting efforts. A “piece of Danish history” is on fire, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, calling the building’s cultural heritage “irreplaceable.” The Børsen building has been at the heart of Danish business since the 17th century. The old stock exchange – located only a few minutes walk from Christiansborg Palace – dates back to 1625. It was built in the Dutch Renaissance style at the request of King Christian IV and had recently been undergoing renovations with its facade covered in scaffolding and protective coverings. Denmark’s culture minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said 400 years of cultural heritage had been damaged. “How touching it is to see how the employees at Børsen, good people from the emergency services and passers-by work together to rescue art treasures and iconic images from the burning building,” he added in a post on X, formerly Twitter. Emergency services were working to control the fire but it had spread to all floors through the elevator shaft. Frank Trier Mikkelsen, operations manager at the Greater Copenhagen fire department, said the fire is burning “violently” inside the building, according to TV 2, a government-owned TV channel. Forty firefighters were inside the building, with valuables being rescued, TV 2 reported. Mikkelsen told the Danish broadcaster that the fire is of a type that emergency managers dread, explaining parts of the building’s roof need to be removed to extinguish it. He added machines have been called in to remove some of the copper roof, as the water just bounces off it. This story has been updated with further developments.\n",

            "The Indonesian government will permanently relocate almost 10,000 residents after a series ofexplosive eruptions of the Ruang volcanohas raised concerns about the dangers of residing on the island in future, a minister said on Friday. About 9,800 people live on Ruang island, in the province of North Sulawesi, but in recent weeks all residents have been forced to evacuate after the mountain has continued tospew incandescent lava and columns of ashkilometers into the sky. Authorities this week raised the alert status of the volcano to the highest level, closed the provincial airport in Manado, and also warned of the a possible tsunami if parts of the mountain collapse into the surrounding waters. Hundreds of “simple but permanent” homes would be built in the Bolaang Mongondow area to facilitate the relocations, said Coordinating Human Development Minister Muhadjir Effendy, after a cabinet meeting to discuss the volcano on Friday. “As instructed by President Joko Widodo, we will build houses that meet disaster-standards,” he said, adding that the site was located about 200 km (125 miles) from Ruang island. Mount Ruang began to dramatically erupt last month, with experts saying the eruptions were triggered by increased seismic activity, including deep sea earthquakes. The mountain erupted again on Tuesday, causing damage to some homes and forcing residents to evacuate from the Tagulandang island, where they had initially sought refuge, to the provincial capital of Manado. Roads and buildings on Tagulandang were blanketed in a thick layer of volcanic ash, and the roofs of some homes had collapsed, according a Reuters witness. The volcano had not erupted on Friday but Manado’s Sam Ratulangi Airport remained closed until the evening due to the spread of volcanic ash. Indonesia straddles the so-called“Pacific Ring of Fire,”an area of high seismic activity where multiple tectonic plates meet.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/americas/canada-sikh-nijjar-assassination-suspects-intl-latam/index.html\n",
            "Three men have been arrested and charged in Canada for allegedly murdering a prominent Sikh separatist, according to police, in a case Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has previously linked to the Indian government, drawing vehement protests from New Delhi. The suspects were identified in court filings as Karanpreet Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, and Karan Brar. The men are accused of conspiring “with others to commit the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar,” according to the filings. They are also charged on a second count for using a firearm “on or about June 18, 2023… to commit first-degree murder.” All three suspects are Indian nationals and non-permanent residents of Canada, police said in a press briefing on Friday. Authorities are currently investigating if they have ties to the Indian government – the latest development in a long-running intrigue that has fueled diplomatic tension between Canada and India. Nijjar, a Canadian citizen, was gunned down by masked men last June outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. He was a prominent campaigner for a separate Sikh homeland out of India, which would be known as Khalistan and include parts of India’s Punjab state. Last September, Trudeau said he had credible information linking the Indian government to the killing of Nijjar. The allegation outraged India, which has forcefully denied the claim, calling it “absurd.” The diplomatic fallout saw tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats from both countries. Authorities did not specify who allegedly conspired with the accused but said there are separate investigations ongoing on Nijjar’s death. “These efforts include investigating connections to the Government of India,” Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner David Teboul told a Friday press conference. Campaigning for the creation of Khalistan has long beenoutlawed in India,where painful memories of a deadly insurgency by some Sikh separatists continue to haunt many. But it garners a level of public sympathy among some in the Sikh diaspora overseas, where activists protected by free speech laws can more openly demand secession from India. Weeks after Trudeau’s announcement, the United States accused an Indian government official ofbeing involved in a conspiracy to kill anotherSikh separatist, American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, onUS soil. A US indictment unsealed in November accused an Indian national, Nikhil Gupta, of trying to kill Pannun, who is a wanted man in India and considered a terrorist by the government. US prosecutors say Gupta was acting on orders from an unnamed Indian government official. India’s government has denied any involvement in the alleged plot to kill Pannun. Just one day after Nijjar was killed in Canada,US prosecutorssay Gupta allegedly told an undercover law enforcement official posing as a hitman that Nijjar had also been one of his targets. “We have so many targets,” Gupta allegedly said. Nijjar’s assassination has sent a chill through Sikh activists living abroad. Dr. Pritpal Singh, an American citizen who heads the American Sikh Caucus Committee, told CNN he was alerted with a “duty to warn” by the FBI of a threat to his life after the Canadian’s assassination. He commended Canadian law enforcement for its “dedication to upholding justice by rigorously pursuing those responsible for these crimes” in a statement, adding that “we, as a community, stand firm in demanding accountability and will continue to advocate for justice to ensure such reprehensible actions are addressed decisively.” This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

            "Colombia says it will break diplomatic relations with Israel on Thursday over its actions inGaza. Colombian President Gustavo Petro made the announcement at a rally in Bogotá’s Bolívar Square on Wednesday, describing the Israeli government’s handling of the war in Gaza as “genocidal.” Israel launched its assault in the Palestinian territory following terror group Hamas’ attacks on October 7, which left more than 1,200 people dead and saw more than 250 taken hostage – many of whom remain in captivity today. Now nearing its eight month, Israel’s war in the isolated enclave has killedmore than 34,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Israel’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, condemned Colombia’s announcement and accused Petro of rewarding Hamas, which controls Gaza, saying he was siding with the “most despicable monsters known to humanity.” Katz also called Petro a “hate-filled, antisemitic president,” but said relations between both countries would remain warm despite the president’s actions. Hamas said it “highly appreciated” Petro’s position, saying in a statement that it considered the decision “a victory for the sacrifices of our people and their just cause” and calling on other countries to follow suit. South Africa has previously accused Israel of violating international laws on genocide, telling theUnited Nations’ top courtthat Israel’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” – a case which Israel dismissed as “absurd blood libel.” The International Court of Justice later ordered Israel to “take all measures” to prevent genocide but stopped short of ordering its government to halt the war. Regional neighbor Bolivia also cut diplomatic ties with Israel last year, citing “crimes against humanity committed against the Palestinian people” in the wake ofIsrael’s war with Hamas.

            "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. “The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moonice. Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-timevia the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA’sArtemisprogram, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. “Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund. “Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.” It could laythe groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space coloniststo use smartphones that can access all theappsand services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a$14.1 million grantin 2020, and in January, Nokia wasselectedby the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventuallyserve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” “A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. “This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.” There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. “Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.\n",

The storm comes just two weeks after record-setting rainfalltriggered damaging floodsin several parts of the country and neighboring Oman, which killed at least four people in the UAE and ground the bustling city of Dubai to a halt. The floods also killed at least 19 others in Oman, including 10 children whose school bus was swept away in the deluge. Video images from the coastal UAE city of Ras Al-Khaimah, shared with CNN, showed palm trees bending in strong winds on Thursday as heavy rains lashed roads and lightning illuminated the sky. The rainfall was not as heavy as the event two weeks ago, but Dubai experienced 20 millimeters in 12 hours, more than twice what it usually receives over the months of April and May combined. Abu Dhabi saw 34 mm in 24 hours, more than four times what it would usually see over April and May. Residents appeared better prepared this time. A CNN journalist in Dubai saw workmen opening drains on the streets a day ahead of the rainfall and emergency notifications were sent widely to mobile phones in the city, warning them to stay home where possible. Authorities ordered remote working and studying in affected areas on Thursday and Friday. Roads to valley areas prone to flooding were closed off, while people were asked to stay away from mountainous, desert and sea areas. Scientists linked the record rainfall that hit the UAE and Oman two weeks ago to climate change. A team of 21 scientists and researchers, under theWorld Weather Attributioninitiative, found that climate change was making extreme rainfall events in the two countries — which typically fall during El Niño years — between 10 and 40% more intense than they would have been without global warming. Over a period of less than 24 hours during that event, the UAE experienced its heaviest rainfall in since records began 75 years ago. Dubai experienced the equivalent of more than a year and a half’s worth of rain in that time. CNN’s Brandon Miller contributed to this report.\n",

            "Scientists working in Indonesia have observed anorangutanintentionally treating a wound on their face with a medicinal plant, the first time this behavior has been documented. Rakus, a male Sumatran orangutan, treated a wound on his face by chewing leaves from a climbing plant named Akar Kuning and repeatedly applying the juice to it, according to a paper published in thejournal Scientific Reportson Thursday. Rakus then covered the wound with the chewed up leaves, which are used in traditional medicine to treat illnesses like dysentery, diabetes and malaria, said scientists. Study lead author Isabelle Laumer, a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, told CNN that the team were “very excited” by their observations, which took place in June 2022 in the Suaq Balimbing research area in Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia. Althoughother wild primate speciesare known to swallow, chew or rub themselves with plants that have medicinal properties, scientists have never seen them used to treat recent wounds. The team believe that Rakus intentionally used the plant to treat his wound as he applied it repeatedly in a process that researchers say took several minutes. “This possibly innovative behavior presents the first report of active wound management with a biological active plant in a great ape species,” she said. Researchers believe that Rakus most likely sustained the wound in a fight with another male orangutan, which are rare in the area thanks to “high food availability, high social tolerance between orangutans and relatively stable social hierarchies,” Laumer explained. This means that orangutans rarely suffer wounds, giving researchers few opportunities to observe this behavior. As for how Rakus would have learned how to treat a wound, one possibility is “accidental individual innovation,” said Laumer. The orangutan may have touched his wound accidentally while feeding on the plant and felt immediate pain relief due to its analgesic – pain relieving – effects, making him repeat the behavior, she explained. Another possible explanation is that Rakus learned how to treat a wound from other orangutans in the area where he was born, said Laumer. The observation “provides new insights into the existence of self-medication in our closest relatives and in the evolutionary origins of wound medication more broadly,” added Laumer, raising the possibility that wound treatment may originate in a common ancestor shared by humans and orangutans. Researchers plan to closely observe any other wounded orangutans in the area to see if the behavior is repeated, said Laumer, who added that the findings underline the commonalities between humans and orangutans. “We are more similar than different,” she said. “We hope this study raises awareness on their critically endangered status in the wild.” Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n",

            "While many celebrity homes look less than lived-in, ranging from spotless minimal to ostentatiously palatial, actor Emma Roberts’ Hollywood Hills home is made for curling up with a good book — or several — with warm tones, comfortable couches, and antique curiosities in each room (also, a lagoon-style pool in the backyard for summer reads). Roberts, an actor who has become a mainstay of rom coms and campy horror — the latter, most recently with recurring roles in the anthology series “American Horror Story” — bought the home, which she shares with her three-year-old son Rhodes, in 2022 and hired the design firm Pierce & Ward to overhaul its interiors. In theMay issue of Architectural Digest, she reveals the results of that makeover. For Roberts, having a space that feels like home is a particular priority, she explained, as she moved often as a child. So when she saw the property listed as a rental on Instagram (it has beenreportedas a former residence of Minnie Driver), she inquired if she could purchase it instead. “I think I lived in 10 houses by the time I was 15 — so for me now, having a son, I wanted a place that felt really ours.” she told AD. “I have a picture of the day we moved in… I just remember feeling like we are exactly where we need to be.” The designers, Louisa Pierce and Emily Ward, with whom Roberts had previously worked, are known for down-to-earth spaces that mix bohemian, mid-century modern and rustic styles. Their clients have included Roberts’ “Madame Web” co-star Dakota Johnson as well as Kate Hudson and Leonardo DiCaprio. “We want a house to look like it’s been there for 50 years,” Pierce told AD in the cover story. “We never want a home to look new.” In that spirit, much of Roberts’ furniture, art and decor is repurposed or reupholstered. In the living room, beneath a disco ball-like globe light, paperbacks are enclosed in living room cabinets while rarer books are openly displayed. Framed photographs of Debbie Harry and Joni Mitchell rest on wooden cabinets; elsewhere, one of Roberts’ most treasured artworks — a Julian Wasser portrait of Joan Didion in front of a Corvette — hangs on the wall. Though many pieces are courtesy of design studios or antique finds, Pierce and Ward don’t look down on more accessible commercial brands. Roberts recalled when she asked if her new kitchen island was custom-made, they laughed and said it was from Urban Outfitters. As for a room for Rhodes, who is starting his own book collection, Roberts opted for a soothing wallpaper scene of flying ducks on the ceiling, above a lush forest-themed upholstered bed. “I remember as a kid, whatever’s on your wall and your ceiling is seared into your brain for the rest of your life,” Roberts explained. “So I wanted to make it extra cozy and fun, but not too overwhelming.”\n",

            "Time is running out to prevent starvation in Darfur, in western Sudan, a UN agency has warned, as escalating violence devastates the African nation. People have been forced to consume “grass and peanut shells,” the regional director for Eastern Africa of the World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday. “If assistance doesn’t reach them soon, we risk witnessing widespread starvation and death in Darfur and across other conflict-affected areas in Sudan,” Michael Dunford added. Sudan has been gripped by civil war since April 2023, when fighting erupted between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It quickly descended into a brutal conflictcharacterized by reportsof sexual and genocidal violence and civilian casualties, triggering an exodus of refugees. On Thursday, two International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) drivers were killed by gunmen in South Darfur, in an attack that left three other staff members injured, according to the humanitarian organization. The ICRC team was attacked en route to assess the crisis among communities affected by armed violence in the region,the organization said. The latest surge in violence comes as the RSF encircles North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher. In the city and its surrounding localities, there have been “increasing arbitrary killings,” systematic “burning of entire villages” and “escalating air bombardments,” the UN deputy humanitarian coordinator for Sudan, Toby Hayward, said on Thursday. Hayward added that El Fasher is the only city in Darfur that has not been captured by the RSF and hosts thousands of people who have been displaced by the war.At least 500,000 of those sheltering in the city have been displaced from violence elsewhere in Sudan, according to the UN’s children’s agency (UNICEF). More than 36,000 people have been forced to flee their homes in El Fasher in recent weeks, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported. At least 43 people have been killed in and around the city since the escalation of fighting a little over two weeks ago, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said on Thursday. “Recent attacks on more than a dozen villages in western El Fasher have resulted in horrific reports of violence, including sexual violence, children injured and killed, homes set on fire, and destruction of critical civilian supplies and infrastructure,” Russell detailed. Meanwhile, deliveries of food assistance in Darfur “have been intermittent due to fighting and endless bureaucratic hurdles” and at least 1.7 million people within the region are experiencing emergency levels of hunger, according to the World Food Programme. “The latest escalation of violence around El Fasher has halted aid convoys coming from Chad’s Tine border crossing – a recently opened humanitarian corridor that passes through North Darfur’s capital,” the WFP added. Restrictions imposed by authorities in the coastal town of Port Sudan have hindered aid deliveries, the WFP said, preventing the transportation of relief via Adré, a town in neighboring Chad.

            "English teenager Kris Kim stunned thegolfing worldon hisPGA Tourdebut, as he became the youngest player to make the cut on tour in nine years – and the youngest ever at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, surpassing the record previously set by Jordan Spieth in 2010. The 16-year-old amateur carded a three-under-68 first round and four-under-67 second round at the tournament in McKinney, Texas, showing few signs of the nerves he later admitted to having on the 18th hole as he shot a birdie putt to make the cut. “To be honest it being a par 5, it’s pretty helpful,” he said afterwards, according to the PGA Tour. “But, yeah, I mean, there is always going to be nerves when you’re on the cut line. “I’ve enjoyed it so much the last couple days,” he added, “and being here two more days makes it so much sweeter.” Kim was introduced to golf aged five by his mother Ji-Hyun Suh, a former professional golfer herself who competed on the LPGA Tour in the 1990s and now serves as his swing coach. “(I) always used to watch her, and then ended up falling in love with it myself,” he told reporters before the tournament, per the PGA Tour. Already, he has enjoyed a wildly successful amateur career, winning the Boys’ Amateur Championship, the European Boys’ Individual Championship and the McGregor Trophy last year. And after making the step up to the PGA Tour, Kim now sits in a tie for 36th place, seven shots behind overnight leader Jake Knapp. The American carded a seven-under 64 in his second round to leapfrog Englishman Matt Wallace who sits in a tie for second place with the USA’s Troy Merritt. Meanwhile, three-time major winner Spieth, whose record Kim broke, failed to make the cut as he continued to struggle with a wrist injury. Kim will tee off for the third round at 9:20 a.m. ET on Saturday, while the final pairing of Knapp and Merritt will tee off at 1:55 p.m. ET.\n",

            "Saudi Arabia and the United States are finalizing the details of a landmark deal to strengthen bilateral trade and defense – but an agreement will not be reached if the kingdom and Israel do not establish diplomatic relations, US officials said. Adefense treatywould solidify the seven-decade security alliance between Saudi Arabia and the US, and tie them ever closer to each other as US adversaries like Iran,Russiaand China seek toexpand their influencein the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long sought relations with Saudi Arabia, home of Islam’s holiest sites, as the move could domino across the wider Muslim world. The US is currently negotiating one mega-deal involving three components, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Thursday. The first component includes a package of agreements between the US and Saudi Arabia, another component has the normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, and a third component for a pathway to a Palestinian state. “All of them are linked together. None go forward without the others,” Miller said. For normalization to be realized between Saudi Arabia and Israel, there has to be a pathway for a Palestinian state and “calm in Gaza,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a panel at an economic conference in Riyadh this week. “The work that Saudi Arabia and the United States have been doing together in terms of our own agreements, I think is potentially very close to completion, but then in order to move forward with normalization two things will be required: calm in Gaza and a crediblepathway to a Palestinian state,” he said. On the sidelines of the forum, Blinken met Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS) to discuss the deal, theState Departmentsaid. Experts describe the Saudi-US pact as a “comprehensive set of understandings” that would include security, economic and technological guarantees to the kingdom, as well as support for its civilian nuclear program. The normalization dealis expected to be modeledon the Abraham Accords, a set of treaties that saw four Arab states recognize Israel in 2020 that sidestepped the longstanding Arab demand for an independent Palestinian state as a prerequisite to recognition of Israel. MBS had said earlier that a pact with Israel would be “the biggest historical dealsince the Cold War.” In 2021, Netanyahu described the Accords as enabling Israel to replace “the old and dangerous doctrine of territories in exchange for peace and brought peace in exchange for peace, without giving up a single inch” and sought to expand what he called the “circle of peace.” Since then, the Biden administration has made Israel-Saudi normalization central to its Middle East policy. The US and Saudi Arabia had continued discussions on the pact in 2023, and Blinken was expected to fly to Riyadh on October 10 last year to discuss the details, just three days before Hamas attacked Israel, postponing the effort. The subsequent Israeli assault on Gaza, which has left the enclave in ruins and killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, may have changed the parameters of the deal for Saudi Arabia, analysts say. Now Israel’s acceptance of a component calling for an “irreversible” pathway to a Palestinian state would be key to the crucial normalization component of the wider deal. “We have the broad outlines on what needs to happen on the Palestinian front…credible, irreversible [pathway to a Palestinian state],” Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told a World Economic Forum panel without referencing normalization with Israel. Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the prospect of an independent Palestinian state, arguing that it would hurt Israel’s security, and is adamant on pressing ahead with the Gaza war until Hamas is eliminated. Those obstacles might see the kingdom attempt to close the bilateral deal without the normalization component of the agreement, analysts say. But such an approach would face major hurdles. An agreement establishing a firm US military commitment to Saudi Arabia’s security, without the normalization component, is unlikely to pass through the US Congress, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has said. “If there is a mutual defense agreement negotiated in the form of a treaty, it needs 67 votes in the Senate to become binding. Without normalizing the Israeli-Saudi relationship and ensuring the security needs of Israel regarding the Palestinian file, there would be very few votes for a mutual defense agreement between the US and Saudi Arabia,” Graham said on X in response to reports of Saudi Arabia opting for a “plan B” to the agreement. Experts say that Biden could be able to bypass Congress to reach the agreement by modeling it around another security agreement it signed with Bahrain last year. “There is another pathway, modeled around the Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement the Biden administration signed with Bahrain in September of 2023,” according to Firas Maksad, Senior Fellow and Director for Strategic Outreach at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC. The text of that pact “explicitly states that other parties may be invited to join,” he said. However, there has been no indication that the Biden administration would opt to bypass Congress for the bilateral agreement with Saudi Arabia to pass. For Saudi Arabia, a bilateral agreement with the US would be a major victory, marking an end to the era when Biden sought to undermine MBS by pledging to turn his country into a “pariah” after the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi intelligence officials in Turkey. The deal would also “consolidate America’s dominance in the Middle East for generations and would blunt the growing challenge posed by both China and Russia,” Maksad said. MBS is eager to bolster the kingdom’s defenses and diversify the Saudi economy away from hydrocarbons, as he pursues an ambitious economic policy dubbed Vision 2030. The kingdom has a nascent civilian nuclear program that the Crown Prince is keen to develop with US support. “Saudi Arabia would like to make a deal with the United States and this is probably the best time during the Biden administration to help some of the stickier issues get through Congress,” according to Karen Young, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, referring toenrichment of nuclear materials. Another sticking point in any US support for such a program is American opposition to local enrichment of uranium, a key component for nuclear power that could also be used to develop nuclear weapons. Saudi Arabia is rich in uranium deposits and has insisted on being able to enrich it domestically, which would be a first for an Arab state. Neighboring United Arab Emirates, for example, imports enriched uranium to power its nuclear plants. On Wednesday, Democratic Senator Edward J. Markey, co-chair of the Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group, called on the Biden administration to ensure thatRiyadh commits to forego enrichmentand reprocessing of nuclear material, citing MBS as saying previously that Saudi Arabia would develop a nuclear weapon if Iran does too. “The path towards Middle East peace should not include the prospect of a nuclear-armed Saudi Arabia, which would undermine the interests of the US, allies, and partners across the region,” he said in his letter. The Saudi-US pact would make it incumbent on both countries to work together to deter and confront any external aggression, but doesn’t formalize it as a treaty alliance, according to Maksad. “It is often described as Article 4.5, stopping just short of a treaty alliance that requires Senate approval but providing for a written commitment of mutual defense,” Maksad said, referring to the NATO treaty’s Article 5, which obliges all member states to come to the defense of any state facing attack. “There will still be room for a multilateral security agreement that eventually includes Israel, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the U.S. and others, when political circumstances allow…the choice will be Israel’s, when it’s ready to put something on the table that moves the ball forward towards a two-state solution with the Palestinians,” Maksad said.\n",

            "Everyone knows the familiar shapes that make upNew York’sskyline. There’s the Art Deco curved crown of theChrysler Building, the sweeping isosceles triangles that twist around One World Trade Center, the stepped limestone and granite rectangles of the Empire State Building and the triangular prism of the Flatiron Building. And now, a multi-billion-dollar tower featuring floor-to-ceiling glass will add another dimension to the cityscape, according to new details unveiled by New York City Mayor Eric Adams this week. Stretching up 62 stories, a planned office tower at 350 Park Avenue will provide space for more than 6,000 jobs, plus 1.8 million square feet of commercial office space, according to a press release. It will be funded by Vornado Realty Trust, Kenneth Griffin, founder and CEO of global investment firm Citadel, and building and management company Rudin. White columns will frame a new public concourse at the base of the new building on Park Avenue, complete with green space, seating and art displays, images show. Above, landscaped terraces will top each section of the glass-clad tower which will house the offices for Citadel and market making firm Citadel Securities. Adams hailed the project in the release, saying it will help “supercharge our economy and expand New York City’s iconic skyline,” building on “continued efforts to energize Midtown Manhattan as the world’s most important business address and an economic engine for working-class New Yorkers.” Architects Foster + Partners have designed the building, which will replace the existing 30-story tower currently at the site in Midtown Manhattan just a few blocks away from landmarks like the Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick’s Cathedral and Grand Central Station. As New York continues to deal with the economic aftershocks wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, Adams and his administration said in their respective statements that they hoped this project would continue the city’s recovery. “This investment opens a new chapter for Midtown — and closes the book on those who predicted its demise,” said deputy mayor for operations Meera Joshi. “Midtown’s revitalization is being led by its public realm — including investments in Fifth Avenue, with the crown jewels of Central Park and Bryant Park at either end. Together, with our business improvement district and parks partners, we are reintroducing Fifth Avenue to the world and creating a vibrant live, work, play community for a new era,”Joshi added. Building this new office space comes at a fraught time for the commercial real estate market as businesses struggle to entice workers back to the office after years of working from home. This has leftvast tranchesof office space vacant or underused, causing the value of such buildings to plummet at the same time as historically high interest rates have made it harder for real estate developers — who often take out huge loans to finance projects — to make good on their repayments. The project will begin the city’s public review process early next yearand the tower is expected to be completed by 2032, according to the release.\n",

            "The five-month wait before US Congress approved $61 billion in military aid to Ukraine may have caused lasting damage that will be felt on the frontlines for months to come. Russian forces have used the “artillery drought” hampering Ukraine’s defenses since December to push forward on the eastern front near Avdiivka, making the largest advance since the early months of the war. Moscow’s progress has prompted warnings from senior Ukrainian military officials of a possible threat to Kyiv’s supply lines and hubs in the east, which are now perilously close to being in range of superior Russian firepower. The bleak news of progress comes ahead of an anticipated Russian offensive in late May, which could threaten Ukraine’s presence in the Donetsk region and hard-fought, if modest, gains towards the occupied port city of Mariupol. Russia has thrown vast resources at weak Ukrainian defenses across the eastern frontlines, pushing toward three key points: the vital military hub of Pokrovsk, west of Avdiivka; the strategic heights of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut; and  Kurakhove in the southeast. On February 17, Ukraine announced it had withdrawn from Avdiivka, a town battled over for a decade, one which Russia appears to have sacrificed hundreds of troops to take. Yet Moscow’s advance did not stop there. Over the next 10 weeks, as a CNN map and analysis by the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepStateMap shows, Russian forces slowly took village after village to Avdiivka’s west, taking advantage of Kyiv’s failure to build fortifications and reluctance to publicly state the extent of their territorial losses in that area. Only on Sunday did the top Ukrainian military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, admit the fall of a series of villages that his subordinates had insisted for days were still contested. The resulting fallback showed Russian forces had, in just over two months, made the most substantial and swift progress since July 2022’s advances near Severodonetsk, according to a CNN analysis. The Ukrainian reluctance to admit these losses led to public criticism from some pro-Ukrainian military bloggers and analysts. DeepStateMap, which updates the frontline situation daily, showed significant losses near Avdiivka. One of the group’s founders, Ruslan Mykula, told CNN they spoke out because they had felt a military “spokesperson has the opportunity to check the real situation, but he [still] provides untrue information and this undermines our credibility.” Mykula said the Russian advances near Ocheretyne, a village taken by Russia in the past weeks west of Avdiivka, are “a tactical success so far,” but could become “a strategic one.” He added: “In the current situation, it will be very difficult to stop the enemy because it is pushing where the defense was not paying enough attention.” He said there was a lack of defensive fortifications along the Avdiivka “entire left flank”—which would effectively mean open plains are now vulnerable almost as far as a key highway that leads to the strategic Ukrainian hub of Pokrovsk. Tuesday’s update from the Ukrainian general staff said their forces were defending a series of villages much closer to Pokrovsk than is comfortable. Tuesday’s presidential address from Volodymyr Zelensky demanded a “significant acceleration of [Western] supplies to significantly strengthen the capabilities of our soldiers.” He said Kyiv’s defenses needed a “strength that must prove itself in the Pokrovsk direction,” along with other perilous frontlines to the south near Kurakhоve, but also to the northeast near Kupiansk. Further Russian advances towards Kurakhove in the southeastern part of this frontline could imperil gains made by Ukraine during the summer counteroffensive. To the north, Russia is regularly bombarding Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, but also pushing hard along the frontlines near Kupiansk, to reoccupy territory liberated by Ukraine in a lightning advance in the late summer of 2022. Ukrainian officials have also warned publicly about the threat to Chasiv Yar, a small town near the city of Bakhmut, brutally torn from Ukrainian control last May. Chasiv Yar sits on a hill, and Lt. Col Nazar Voloshyn, spokesman for the Ukrainian Khortytsia command, said Tuesday on Ukrainian television that Russian forces were aiming to push along the canal near it, and seize it to gain a strategic advantage over vital nearby Ukrainian military towns. “It would be very important for them to take Chasiv Yar before we receive foreign aid … when we stop having a shortage of ammunition,” Voloshyn told Ukrainian television. “If the enemy captures the dominant heights and the occupiers gain a foothold there, it will be a big problem for us, because Kostiantynivka, Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and Druzhkivka will immediately come under attack.” If those four towns, which sit along the same highway, were to come under serious threat of capture, Russia’s goal of control over the entire Donetsk region would come much closer to fruition. Yurii Fedorenko,commander of the Achilles attack drones company at the 92nd separate assault brigade in that area, said the next two months marked a “window of opportunity” for Russian forces. He said Russian forces had realized Ukraine will soon “have the necessary air defense assets and the necessary range of ammunition concentrated on the frontline, which will make it impossible for the enemy to perform tasks with the intensity it has now.”\n",

            "Powerful storms roared across parts of southern Oklahoma Tuesday night and produced dangerous and unusual tornadoes, including one incredibly rare type. Multiple tornadoes were ongoing simultaneously in Tillman County, Oklahoma, when the weather got weird. At least two of the tornadoes exhibited very odd behavior: one powerful tornado looped backward and recrossed its previous path and another significant tornado spun in the “wrong” direction. “You certainly don’t see this every day,” Rick Smith, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma, told CNN. Even stranger, the tornadoes appear to have emerged from the same powerful thunderstorm. Here’s how it played out. A supercell thunderstorm – a powerful type of storm responsible for most severe weather – roared to life near the Oklahoma-Texas border and tracked east. This storm produced a “large and extremely dangerous” tornado north of Loveland, Oklahoma, just before 10 p.m. CDT, according to a weather service warning. Radar imagery shows the tornado tracking east before slowing down considerably, taking a turn to the north, then to the west, and looping over where it had just hit. Storms generally move from west to east, but powerful tornadoes can sometimes curve back to the west as they lose strength, according to Smith. What’s much more uncommon in this situation is that the tornado completed a full loop back over its own path. An EF5 tornadothat decimated the town of Greensburg, Kansas, in May 2007 is perhaps the most devastating example of a looping track. The tornado demolished the town and then looped back just north of the worst damage. Tuesday night’s spiraling tornado weakened as it completed its pirouette near Loveland, but a new issue then emerged: a new, powerful anticyclonic tornado spun up on the southern edge of the same storm. It’s likely these two tornadoes were briefly active at the same time, Smith said. Tornadoes in the Northern Hemisphere typically spin cyclonically, or counter-clockwise, but this new tornado was spinning clockwise, or anti-cyclonically. Only about 1% of tornadoes are estimated to be anticyclonic, according to the weather service. Tuesday night’s anticyclonic tornado was one for the history books on several fronts. Just before 10:30 p.m. CDT the “large and extremely dangerous” anticyclonic tornado formed southeast of Loveland where it was briefly “nearly stationary or moving very slowly south,” according to weather service warnings. “It’s not common to see (tornadoes) be nearly stationary,” Smith explained. “Tornadoes are almost always going to just go wherever the supercell thunderstorm goes.” But select storms on Tuesday night were barely moving and created an environment where it was possible for a tornado to develop, loiter, then redevelop, according to Smith. Not only was this tornado churning in the “wrong” direction while hardly moving forward, it also produced tell-tale damage signatures on radar imagery that meant it lifted debris thousands of feet into the air, a sign of a strong tornado. Most anticyclonic tornadoes are weak and short-lived, meaning this twister was rare on two fronts. Luckily, the erratic twisters unfolded over a sparsely populated area and there are no reports of injuries, deaths or significant structural damage, theTillman County Emergency Management office saidWednesday afternoon. Additional severe thunderstorms arepossible from Texas to Nebraska Wednesday. Some of these storms may produce tornadoes, including in the same areas of southwestern Oklahoma hit by Tuesday night’s storms.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/03/europe/italy-bans-puppy-yoga-scli-intl/index.html\n",
            "Italy’s Ministry of Health has banned the popular wellness trend of “puppy yoga” amid concerns that the puppies used in the practice could be exploited and mistreated. Typically, sessions involve puppies roaming around a yoga class and sometimes being incorporated in poses. Giovanni Leonardi, head of the One Health department of Italy’s health ministry, ruled Tuesdaythat the use of dogs during exercise sessions falls under Italy’s Animal Assisted Interventions act. This means that only adult dogs can now be used in yoga sessions to “protect the health and well-being of the animals, as well as the safety of users.” The ruling comes following an investigation in March by the popular Italian news show “Striscia la Notizia,” which alleged that puppies were mistreated at various yoga centers and kept in pens between sessions. Animal rights charity Lega Nazionale per la Difesa del Cane (National League for the Defense of Dogs) filed a complaint with the Italian health ministry after these allegations came to light, telling authorities in documents seen by CNN that the puppies were treated “as if they were gymnastics tools.” The puppies used in the sessions were transported in boxes or plastic bags, were used for long hours covering multiple sessions, and were not provided water or food to “prevent the dogs from doing their business in the gym,” LNDC alleged, noting that the Striscia la Notizia investigation found that many of the puppies were only 42 days old. “Given their age, it is highly likely that these puppies had not even completed their vaccination prophylaxis,” the LNDC complaint suggested. CNN reached out to several Italian puppy yoga centers for comment with no success. The ruling does not have a legal arena for appeal, a spokesperson for Italy’s health ministry said. “It is the same as any service animal. You would never expect to see a puppy as a sight dog,” the spokesperson told CNN Friday. LNDC’s President Piera Rosati called the practice “exploitation for commercial purposes that takes no account of the well-being and psychophysical health of creatures who are still too fragile to be treated in this way.” “At that age, puppies should not have to face travel and stress, but stay in a calm and protected environment under the guidance and care of their mother who can teach them to socialize correctly and to face the outside world with confidence,” Rosati continued. Elisa Allen, vice president of programs and operations at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) UK, commended Italy for banning puppy yoga in a statement to CNN Friday. Allen called the practice “a sales gimmick designed to promote the breeding of ‘pedigree’ dogs – who are prone to severe physical problems later in life – and which violates the fundamental principle of yoga: ahimsa, or doing no harm.” “While governments around the world should take heed, we must not wait to do the right thing: PETA urges yogis to stay away from this cheap ploy that uses sensitive animals as props to their detriment,” Allen said.\n",

            "(CNN) —The Italian artist and provocateur Maurizio Cattelan shines a light on gun violence and the divisions in US society in a new installation at Gagosian in New York City. Cattelan’s piece “Sunday (2024)” consists of 64 stainless-steel panels plated in 24-carat gold and dotted with thousands of bullet holes. The work was created by a group of licensed professionals at a gun range in Brooklyn, who shot more than 20,000 rounds into the 3mm-thick panels, which were made in Europe. “We live in a world where the rich are getting richer and the poor are becoming poorer,” Cattelan told The Art Newspaper. “History has taught us how violently that polarization can end. “This idea was present in ‘America’ (thesolid-gold toiletinstalled at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 2016), and I have used gold once again to talk about another aspect of the United States. America was about wealth, and this new work is about violence and wealth,” he added. While Gagosian declined to comment on cost, The Art Newspaper understands that the panels are individually priced between $300,000 and $400,000. Cattelan is not represented by Gagosian but instead chooses to work with galleries on individual projects. The work is paired with an editioned marble sculpture, “November (2024),” that depicts an unhoused figure urinating on a bench. “If you’re free to buy an assault rifle in a department store, what’s wrong with pissing in public?” Francesco Bonami, the exhibition curator, said in a statement. The artist is known for his headline-hitting conceptual works — such as “Comedian,” his 2019 showstopper at Art Basel in Miami Beach. “Comedian” was just a banana attached to the wall with grey duct tape, but the conceptually audacious, over-ripe readymade drew crowds and divided critics.

            "Italy has the right to confiscate a life-size bronze statue dating back to the second or third centuries B.C. from the J. Paul Getty Villa Museum in Los Angeles, California, where it has been for half a century, according to a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday. The ruling came after the Getty Museum asked the European Court of Human Rights to intervene following a 2018 Italian court decree that the bronze statue should be confiscated and returned to Italy. The statue, found at the bottom of the Adriatic Sea by fishermen in 1964, has been at the center of a decades-long effort by Italy to reclaim its “stolen” cultural heritage. According to court documents, Italian officials claim the piece was stolen and smuggled out of the country before being eventually sold to the Getty Museum for around $4 million in 1978. The statue — known in Italy as the “Athlete of Fano,” but named by The Getty Museum as both the “Getty Bronze” and the “Victorious Youth” — is attributed to sculptor Lysippos and remains one of the most important examples of ancient Greek art from the Classical era, according to Italy’s Cultural Heritage Ministry. The Getty Museum does not agree with the latest ruling. In a statement, they said: “We believe that Getty’s nearly 50-year public possession of an artwork that was neither created by an Italian artist nor found within the Italian territory is appropriate, ethical and consistent with American and international law.” Italian authorities have been on a quest to recover hundreds of artworks illegally dug out of excavation sites or stolen by so-called tomb raiders and sold on the black market and the Victorious Youth has long been in their sights. In 2007, the Getty returned 40 artifacts of questionable provenance in a landmark deal that paved the way for many other museums around the world to return stolen art and artifacts to Italy and Greece. The Victorious Youth wason the 2007 list, but the Getty refused to return it, citing the fact that it was found in international waters, and therefore not necessarily an Italian artifact. Italy’s Minister of Culture, Gennaro Sangiuliano, said the European court finally set the record straight on the contested bronze. “The European Court of Strasbourg has recognized the rights of the Italian State with an unequivocal ruling,” he said in a statement. “The judges were clear regarding the ownership of the ‘Victorious Athlete’ statue, found in the waters near the Marche coast and then stolen abroad. We will continue our action with renewed determination to have her back in Italy soon,” he said. “We have interrupted all collaborative relationships with those foreign cultural institutions that do not respect the confiscation provisions issued by the Italian judicial authority for illegal export of cultural goods.” The ministry also said it would now focus on other contentious pieces. “Activities continue to achieve the return from the Louvre Museum of various stolen artifacts… as well as for the return to Italy of the Doryphoros of Stabia from the Minneapolis Museum.” “This is not just a victory for the Italian government. It’s a victory for culture,” Maurizio Fiorilli, an Italian government attorney, said after the court ruling. Italy will now work with US authorities to return the statue, a spokesperson for the cultural ministry told CNN.\n",

            "A 40-something woman was buried in a cave 75,000 years ago, laid to rest in a gully hollowed out to accommodate her body. Her left hand was curled under her head, and a rock behind her head may have been placed as a cushion. Known as Shanidar Z, after the cave in Iraqi Kurdistanwhere she was found in 2018, the woman was a Neanderthal, a type of ancient human that disappeared around 40,000 years ago. Scientists studying her remains have painstakingly pieced together her skull from 200 bone fragments, a process that took nine months. They used the contours of the face and skull to guide a reconstruction to understand what she may have looked like.The striking recreation is featured in a new documentary “Secrets of the Neanderthals” produced by BBC for Netflix, which is available for streaming on Thursday. With pronounced brow ridges and no chins, the skulls of Neanderthals look different from those of our own species, Homo sapiens, said Dr. Emma Pomeroy, a paleoanthropologist and associate professor with the University of Cambridge’s department of archaeology who unearthed the skeleton and appears in the new film. The Shanidar Z facial reconstruction suggests that these differences might not have been so stark in life, Pomeroy said. “There is some artistic license there, but at the heart of it is the real skull and real data on what we know about (these) people,” she said. “She’s actually got quite a large face for her size,” Pomeroy added. “She’s got quite big brow ridges, which typically we wouldn’t see, but I think dressed in modern clothes you probably wouldn’t look twice.” Neanderthals lived across Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia Mountains for around 300,000 years, overlapping with modern humans for 30,000 years or so. Analysis of DNA from present-day humans has revealed that, during this time, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens occasionally encountered one another and interbred. When Pomeroy first excavated the skeleton, its sex wasn’t immediately obvious because only the upper half of the body was preserved. It lacked telltale pelvic bones. The team that initially studied the remainsrelied on a relatively new technique involving the sequencing of proteins inside tooth enamel to determine Shanidar Z’s sex, which is revealed for the first time in the documentary.﻿ Those researchers from the universities of Cambridge and Liverpool estimated the specimen’s height to have been around 5 feet (1.5 meters) by comparing the length and diameter of her arm bones with data on modern humans. An analysis of wear and tear on teeth and bones suggested she was in her mid-40s at the time of her death. “It’s a reasonable estimate, but we can’t be 100% sure, actually, that they weren’t older,” Pomeroy said. “What we can say is this is someone who had lived a relatively long life. For that society, they probably would have been quite important in terms of their knowledge, their life experience.” The cave where Shanidar Z was buried is well-known among archaeologists because a Neanderthal grave discovered there in 1960 led researchers to believe that Neanderthals may have interred their dead with flowers — the first challenge to the prevailing view that the ancient humans were dumb and brutish. Subsequent research by Pomeroy’s team, however, has cast doubt on that flower burial theory.Instead, they suspect the pollen discovered among the gravesmay have arrived via pollinating bees. Still, over the years scientists have found increasing evidence of Neanderthals’ intelligence, sophistication and complexity, includingart, stringandtools. Neanderthals repeatedly returned to Shanidar Cave to lay their dead to rest. The remains of 10 Neanderthals have been unearthed at the site, half of which appear to have been buried deliberately in succession, research has found. Neanderthals may not have honored their dead with bouquets of flowers, but the inhabitants of Shanidar Cave were likely an empathetic species, research suggests. For example,one male Neanderthal buried therewas deaf and had a paralyzed arm and head trauma that probably rendered him partially blind, yet he lived a long time, so he must have been cared for, according to research. Shanidar Z is the first Neanderthal found in the cave in more than 50 years, Pomeroy said, but the site could still yield more discoveries. During the filming of the documentary in 2022, Pomeroy uncovered a left shoulder blade, some rib bones and a right hand belonging to another Neanderthal. “I think our interpretation at the moment,” she said, “is that actually this is probably the remains of a single individual, which has then been disturbed.” Pomeroy described reconstructing Shanidar Z’s skull, which had been crushed relatively soon after death as a “high-stakes 3D jigsaw puzzle.” The fossilized bones were hardened with a glue-like substance, removed in small blocks of cave sediment and wrapped in foil before researchers sent them to the University of Cambridge for analysis. In the Cambridge lab, researchers took micro-CT scans of each block and used the scans to guide extraction of bone fragments. Pomeroy’s colleague Dr. Lucía López-Polín, an archaeological conservator from the Catalan Institute for Human Palaeoecology and Social Evolution in Spain, pieced over 200 bits of skull together by eye to return it to its original shape. The team scanned and 3D-printed the rebuilt skull, which formed the basis of a reconstructed head created by Dutch paleoartists Adrie and Alfons Kennis, twin brothers who built up layers of fabricated muscle and skin to reveal Shanidar Z’s face. Pomeroy said the reconstruction helped “bridge that gap between anatomy and 75,000 years of time.” Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the nationality of the Kennis brothers.\n",

            "“Whoever stays until the end, will tell the story. We did what we could. Remember us.” Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila scrawled these farewell words in blue ink on a whiteboard in Al-Awda Hospital, in Jabalya, on October 20, according toMédecins Sans Frontières(Doctors Without Borders). When Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led October 7 attacks, many local journalists did stay – risking their lives to tell the stories of their people. After more than 200 days of fighting, Israeli bombardment has turned neighborhoods into rubble. Families have been torn apart by deaths andforced displacement; thethreat of starvationlooms. At the same time, 129 of the more than 250 hostages seized from Israel by Hamas remain captive in the territory, of whom at least 34 are thought to be dead. Trapped in the strip alongside their fellow Gaza residents, Palestinian reporters have become the eyes and ears of those suffering under the shadow of war. And with foreign media largely unable to enter, it is their photos, footage and reporting, often gathered at great personal risk, that have shown the world what is happening. At least 97 journalists and media workers have been killed since October – 92 of whom were Palestinian – according to theCommittee to Protect Journalists(CPJ). This makes it the deadliest period for journalists since 1992, when the CPJ started collecting data. Gazan journalists told CNN they are haunted by their colleagues’ deaths, as they balance the emotional labor of covering the war with trying to protect their families. Displaced reporters working in makeshift tentsrisk exposureto Israeli strikes. Some say they were forced to flee their homes without equipment or protective gear, instead relying on mobile phones to show the world what is happening. Others must travel to higher ground when uploading footage, in an effort to bypass power outages and communications disruptions as Israeli shelling persists. Images of Al-Jazeera’s Gaza bureau chief Wael Al-Dahdouh shakingwith griefafter 12 family memberswere killedin an Israeli strike in central Gaza last October became symbolic of the plight of journalists there. “We are covering the war on Gaza because this is our journalistic duty. It is entrusted upon us,” said 31-year-old Mariam Abu Dagga, a photojournalist for the Independent Arabic displaced in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “We challenged the Israeli occupation. We challenged the difficult circumstances and the reality of this war, a genocidal war.” Human rights agencies have repeatedly called for the protectionof journalistsin the enclave. In February, UN expertswarned that“targeted attacks and killings of journalists are war crimes.” Releasing its annual Press Freedom Index on Friday for World Press Freedom Day, Reporters Without Borders warned the past year marked “a clear lack of political will on the part of the international community to enforce the principles of the protection of journalists.” The war in Gaza saw “a record number of violations against journalists and media” since October, according to the report. Palestine - the term the organization uses for the Palestinian territories, and which is ranked 157th out of 180 countries and territories surveyed - is the deadliest region for journalists. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not answer CNN’s questions regarding the allegations made by several journalists over threats to the safety of reporters working in the Gaza Strip. The IDF told CNN it could not comment on allegations of targeted attacks without geographic coordinates and the specific time, but provided CNN with a statement it has often used during the war in Gaza. CNN provided names, locations and dates for the strikes in question. “In response to Hamas’ barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities,” the IDF said in a statement. “In stark contrast to Hamas’ intentional attacks on Israeli men, women and children, the IDF follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm including journalists. The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists. “Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians,” the statement added. Israel launched a military assault on Gaza on October 7 after the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, killed at least 1,200 people in Israel and abducted more than 250 others. Israeli attacks in Gaza have since killed more than 34,600 Palestinians and injured more than 77,800 people as of May 1, according to the Ministry of Health there. Of those killed, about seven in 10 are women and children, the ministry said. CNN cannot independently confirm the figures due to the lack of international media access. “Whenever a journalist is targeted, we ask ourselves who among us will get their turn of being targeted tomorrow,” said Abu Dagga. “We don’t have cover and we don’t have security.” Since October, Abu Dagga has spent every day in Gaza wondering if it will be her last. Still, she does not leave, despite making the gut-wrenching decision to send her 12-year-old boy to live with his father in the United Arab Emirates. “The war is the only thing that separated me from my son,” she told CNN. Abu Dagga says she sent him away for his safety after documenting the deaths of children killed by Israel’s bombardment. As of April 30, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 14,100 children, the Ministry of Heath said. Palestinian media workers provide a critical window into thehorrors ofIsrael’s offensive in Gaza. The few foreign journalists who have been allowed to enter the enclave have primarily embedded with the IDF and may have had to submit their footage to the military for security review, although maintaining editorial control. Both Israel and Egypt, which control Gaza’s borders, have so far refused to give international journalists unfettered access to the strip, saying that they cannot guaranteetheir safety. Abu Dagga says her parents in northern Gaza worry for her survival when she goes out to work, after hearing about the many colleagues she has lost during the war. Others have evacuated, grappling with the heartbreak of leaving relatives behind, while still working to tell Gaza’s story. After nearly seven months of war, Abu Dagga told CNN that she, too, wants to leave. “There is no place for us to live,” she said. “We have been subjected to repeated shelling and we are still being targeted.” Like Abu Dagga, local photojournalist Mohammad Ahmed treads the line between life and death. Shrapnel pierced his leg following an Israeli attack on a building in Jabalya, in northern Gaza, on December 17, Ahmed recalls. Clouds of dust filled the air, as people screamed frantically. The photojournalist for Turkish state broadcaster TRT told CNN he had been traveling through the neighborhood, after being displaced from the local refugee camp. His protective press vest absorbed a hit to his stomach, he says. But doctors could not remove the shrapnel lodged in his upper right thigh. “I started to shout that I had been injured. Nobody was able to hear me,” said Ahmed. “I saw people lying on the street… parts of dead bodies were scattered around.” The father-of-three says he is tormented by repeatedly documenting scenes of war, whether it be children calling for help from under the rubble, or injured Palestinians flooding into a hospital following an Israeli strike. Sometimes, he says, he must stop filming and let his emotions out. “I am also a human,” Ahmed said. “I would stop filming and try to find an empty place to cry… These scenes affect us immensely because those are our people, and they are human, and they are like our children.” He has not yet met his two-month-old son, Adnan. His wife, then pregnant, and two daughters fled first to Rafah and then to Egypt in November. His parents and siblings have been displaced across the strip, he says. But there is little time to grieve for what’s been lost. “Given the nature of my job, I knew I wouldn’t be available beside my family during the war… I was sure this war was going to be bigger than us all,” he said. For others, the risk of losing their family meant they felt no choice but to leave Gaza. Ibrahim Dahman and his young familywere displacedmultiple times as bombardment intensified around their home in Sheikh Radwan, northern WadiGaza. The CNN producer drove desperately further south along with his pregnant wife, Rasha, and two children – Zeid, now 11, and Khalil, 7 – under the distant echo of Israel’s aerial campaign. “This was a huge burden on me,” Dahman, 36, told CNN last month. In November, he and his familyevacuatedto Cairo, in neighboring Egypt. “When we hear the sounds of civilian aircraft in Cairo, we panic,” he said. “I was forced to leave to protect my children and my wife. We left the rest of my family in Gaza, who are still suffering every day.” As Dahman continues to document the warfor CNN, more than 40 relatives from his mother’s and father’s families havebeen killedby Israeli strikes. His apartment in Sheikh Radwan has been reduced to debris – erasing precious memories, including photographs of his grandparents and gifts from friends. “What motivates me to cover the war in Gaza is that I was born in Gaza. I am a son of Gaza. I lived there, studied there, and worked in Gaza for years,” he told CNN. Surviving journalists told CNN they are determined to honor the legacy of their colleagues who have been killed. The editor-in-chief of Al-Khamsa news website, Saeed Al-Taweel, was killed by an Israeli airstrike on October 10, in the west of Gaza City, according to the Palestiniannews agency Wafa. A colleague who had sheltered with Al-Taweel on the night he was killed, Alaa Abu Mohsen, said Al-Taweel had gone to film the Hajja tower in Gaza when it was hit by a strike. “I walked to find Saeed, and he was lying on the ground at the crossroads that connects to Phoenix and Hajja… After that, I transferred his body to his family in Rafah,” Mohsen said. Al-Taweel was famed among Palestinians in Gaza for his morning show, “Akhabr ’Arrei,” meaning ‘news on an empty stomach’, according to Saba Al-Jaafrawi, 32, a close friend and journalist. She described him as a “kind and generous person who took the initiative to do God’s deeds and help people in need.” “We used to go to work early in the morning and hear people talking about his morning news show… You would hear people say, ‘Saeed wrote” and ‘Saeed said,’” Al-Jaafrawi told CNN. “Losing Saeed was an immense loss both on the journalistic level and on the societal level. The fate of at least two other Palestinian journalists remains unknown, according to the CPJ. Thirty-one-year-old Nidal al-Wahidi, a photojournalist, has not been heard from since he was detained by Israeli forces alongside fellow photojournalist Haitham Abdelwahed, 25, while reporting on the Hamas-led October 7 attacks into southern Israel, according to a report byAmnesty Internationalin December and testimony from his cousin provided to CNN. Israeli authorities have refused to disclose their location or the legal grounds for their arrest, Amnesty said, adding that it was not known whether they were dead or alive. Al-Wahidi had travelled to the Erez/Beit Hanoun checkpoint to film the attacks, Amnesty International said. Major international news organizations, like Getty Images, purchased his photos. CNN asked the IDF to disclose the whereabouts of Al-Wahidi and Abdelwahed, the reasons for their arrest and their current condition. The IDF did not provide a response. Al-Wahidi’s cousin, Fadi Wael Abdel Karim Al-Wahidi, who is also a journalist still working in Gaza, said the family had identified Nidal based on photos released by the IDF of people detained on October 7. “So, we went back to the Red Cross and told them: ‘This is a picture of Nidal, and his family recognized him,’” Fadi told CNN. He said the Red Cross told them the IDF had not provided information about people detained on October 7. CNN reached out to the IDF about the allegations made by Fadi. Fadi, 24, described Nidal as a “family figure” who was “very kind.” He had worked alongside his cousin, he said, recalling that Nidal was dedicated to his job and knew “the time for laughter was for laughter, and the time for work was for work.” Speaking to CNN, Fadi had one message for his cousin. “I swear to God, we missed him. We missed him so much. Not only me, but my entire family hopes that Nidal will return because we are very fond of him. We hope that God will bring him back to us safely.” Whether they report from within the enclave, or elsewhere, Palestinian journalists told CNN they could not turn away from the horrors unfolding in Gaza. Instead, they do as Nujaila, the doctor at Al-Awda hospital, asked at the beginning of the war — telling the stories of besieged Palestinians inside the territory so they are not forgotten.\n",

            "An unusual asteroid traveling near Earth is thought to bea chunk of the moon, but exactly how it ended up zooming through the solar system has remained a mystery. Now, researchers say they’ve made a key connection in this cosmic puzzle. The space rock, known as 2016 HO3, is a rare quasi-satellite — a type of near-Earth asteroid that orbits the sun but sticks close to our planet. Astronomers first discovered it in 2016 using the Pan-STARRS telescope, or Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, in Hawaii. Scientists call the asteroid Kamo’oalewa, a name derived from a Hawaiian creation chant that alludes to an offspring traveling on its own. While most near-Earth asteroids originate from the main asteroid belt — between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter — new research has revealed that Kamo’oalewa most likely came from the Giordano Bruno crater on the moon’s far side, or the side that faces away from Earth, according to a study published April 19 in the journalNature Astronomy. It’s the first time astronomers have traced a potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroid to a lunar crater, said lead study author Yifei Jiao, a visiting scholar at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and a doctoral student at Tsinghua University in Beijing.“This was a surprise, and many were skeptical that it could come from the moon,” said study coauthor Erik Asphaug, professor at the University of Arizona’s laboratory, in a statement. “For 50 years we have been studying rocks collected by astronauts on the surface of the moon, as well as hundreds of small lunar meteorites that were ejected randomly by asteroid impacts from all over the moon that ended up on Earth. Kamo’oalewa is kind of a missing link that connects the two.”In addition to helping confirm Kamo’oalewa’s potential relationship to the moon, the findings could ultimately lead to other revelations — including how the ingredients for life made their way to Earth. Measuring between 150 and 190 feet (46 and 58 meters) in diameter, Kamo’oalewa is about half the size of theLondon EyeFerris wheel. During orbit, it comes within 9 million miles (14.5 million kilometers) of Earth, making it a potentially hazardous asteroid astronomers keep track of and learn more about in case it ever strays too close to our planet. Previous research focused on the asteroid’s reflectivity, which unlike typical near-Earth asteroids is similar to lunar materials, as well as the space rock’s low orbital velocity in relation to Earth, a quality that suggests it came from relatively nearby. For the new study, astronomers used simulations to narrow down which of the moon’s thousands of craters could have been the asteroid’s point of origin. Based on the modeling, the team determined that the impactor that potentially created the asteroid would need to be at least 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) in diameter to dislodge such a massive fragment. When the object hit the moon, it likely dug Kamo’oalewa out from beneath the lunar surface, sending the space rock flying and leaving a crater larger than 6 to 12 miles (10 to nearly 20 kilometers) in diameter. These simulations also helped the team search for a relatively young crater, given that the asteroid is only estimated to be a few million years old, while the moon is believed to be 4.5 billion years old. These parameters helped researchers zero in on Giordano Bruno, a 14-mile-wide (22-kilometer-wide) crater estimated to be 4 million years old, as the likely spot where Kamo’oalewa started its journey. The study’s simulations showed that Kamo’oalewa was excavated from the lunar surface at several miles per second. “You’d think the impact event would pulverize and distribute the (lunar material) far and wide,” Asphaug said. “But there it is. So, we turned the problem around and asked ourselves, ‘How can we make this happen?’” Based on their models, the team believes the impact event sent tens of hundreds of 32.8-foot (10-meter) fragments flying into space. Yet Kamo’oalewa survived as a massive, singular fragment. “While most of that debris would have impacted the Earth as lunar meteorites over the course of less than a million years, a few lucky objects can survive in (sun-centric) orbits as near-Earth asteroids, yet to be discovered or identified,” Jiao said. Understanding how such a giant chunk of the moon could remain intact enough to become an asteroid could help scientists studying panspermia, or the idea that the ingredients for life may have been delivered to Earth as “organic hitchhikers” on space rocks such as asteroids, comets or other planets. “While Kamo’oalewa comes from a lifeless planet, it demonstrates how rocks ejected from Mars could carry life — at least in principle,” Asphaug said. Studying crater impacts on the moon can also help scientists better understand the consequences of asteroid impacts should a space rock pose a threat to Earth in the future. “Testing the new model of Kamo’oalewa’s origin from a specific, young lunar crater paves the way for obtaining ground-truth knowledge of the damage that asteroid impacts can cause to planetary bodies,” said study coauthor Renu Malhotra, a planetary sciences professor at the University of Arizona, in a statement. China’s Tianwen-2 mission, launching in 2025, will visit Kamo’oalewa with the aim of collecting samples from the asteroid and eventually returning them to Earth. “It will be different in important ways from any of the specimens we have so far — one of those connecting pieces that help you solve the puzzle,” Asphaug said. Studying a sample excavated from the lunar far side could reveal insights into a part of the moon that has been less studied and shed light on the composition of its subsurface. Given that the impact likely happened a few million years ago — relatively young on astronomical timescales — the samples could also help scientists study how space radiation causes weathering and erosion on asteroids over time. “The exciting thing is that when a space mission visits an asteroid and returns some samples, we have surprises and unexpected outcomes, that usually go beyond what we were anticipating,” said study coauthor Dr. Patrick Michel, astrophysicist and director of research at the National Centre for Scientific Research in France. “So, whatever Tianwen-2 will return, it will be an extraordinary new source of information, as all asteroid missions so far.” For a long time, astronomers thought it was impossible for meteorites to come from the moon until lunar meteorites were found on Earth, said Noah Petro, NASA project scientist for both the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and Artemis III. Petro was not involved in the study. The hope is that future samples could confirm the lunar origin of Kamo’oalewa. “Going there and finding out is absolutely a way to go about it now,” Petro said. “It’s a great, great reminder that we live in a very exciting solar system and we live in a very exciting corner of the solar system with our moon. There’s no other place, no other planetin our solar system with a moon like our moon. And things like this are great reminders of how special the Earth-moon system is.”\n",

            "Britain’sKing Charles IIIwill resume public duties next week following “a period of treatment and recuperation,” Buckingham Palace announced Friday, two months after revealing that he was beingtreated for cancer. The 75-year-old monarch will be joined by his wife, Queen Camilla, for a visit to a cancer treatment center on Tuesday “where they will meet medical specialists and patients,” according to a palace statement. It is understood that the facility is not the same treatment center that has been directly involved in the King’s medical care. It will be the first of several engagements the King is expected to carry out in the weeks ahead. The palace also announced that the British sovereign would host Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako for a state visit in June. “As the first anniversary of the Coronation approaches, Their Majesties remain deeply grateful for the many kindnesses and good wishes they have received from around the world throughout the joys and challenges of the past year,” the palace statement concluded. A royal source said there were no plans to share any further details specific to the monarch’s condition or treatment plan. However, a Buckingham Palace spokesperson added that “His Majesty is greatly encouraged to be resuming some public-facing duties and very grateful to his medical team for their continued care and expertise.” Friday’s announcement was accompanied by a new portrait of the King and Queen taken to mark one year since the couple were crowned at Westminster Abbey in London last May. The picture was taken by Millie Pilkington, one of the UK’s most respected portrait photographers, within the gardens of Buckingham Palace on April 10, the morning after the pair’s 19th wedding anniversary. Camilla, 76, is dressed in an indigo day dress with velvet detail by couturier Fiona Clare. The palace spokesperson said the King will continue treatment but that doctors were “sufficiently pleased with the progress made so far” to let him resume some public-facing duties. The spokesperson said it was “too early to say” how much longer the King’s treatment would continue but his medical team “remain positive” regarding his ongoing recovery. They added that upcoming events in his diary will be adapted where necessary to minimize any risks to his recuperation. The palace did not specify how many engagements were being added to the King’s diary or whether he would be able to attend his birthday parade in London or the D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations in Normandy in June. Instead, the spokesperson said “planning continues for ways in which Their Majesties may attend such Summer and Autumn engagements, though nothing can be confirmed or guaranteed at this stage.” Forthcoming public engagements will continue to be announced closer to the time and in consultation with the King’s doctors. But the palace spokesperson did clarify that Charles was not expected to carry out a full summer program. The royal source also told CNN that Charles would be able to meet with people indoors and outdoors but that each engagement would be carefully managed to minimize any risks to the King’s recovery. Charles’ last public appearance was onEaster Sundaywhen he went to church in Windsor with several family members. He delighted waiting crowds by making an unexpected walkabout and heading over to them after leaving St. George’s Chapel. He stopped to chat to well-wishers and shake hands with members of the public. Throughout his treatment, the King has continued to carry out his constitutional duties, receiving his daily red boxes and paperwork. This week he gave royal assent to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s controversialplan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. Charles’ rubberstamping of the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, which was approved earlier this week, was announced in the House of Lords on Thursday. He has also continued to hold private meetings, most recently holding an audience with Adm. Benjamin Key, First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, on April 16. Charles announced hiscancer diagnosisand that he would step back from public-facing duties while undergoing treatment in early February. Catherine, Princess of Wales revealed her own cancer battle last month, in a second blow to the British royal family. She has not been seen on official public duties since Christmas Day but on Tuesday, the Waleses continued the tradition of sharing a photo to mark their children’s birthdays when a photo taken by Kate was uploaded to their social media accounts forPrince Louis’ sixth birthday. In the King’s absence, Prince William and Queen Camilla have been holding down the fort for public outings, leading the family with the support of Princess Anne, Prince Edward and other royals. On Thursday, the Prince of Wales made a trip to the West Midlands, visiting a number of projects supporting mental health and wellbeing.\n",

            "An Israeli airstrike on Al-Shaboura refugee camp in southernGaza’sRafah city late Tuesday killed two young children and injured several other people, according to the Palestinian Civil Defense in Gaza and the Kuwait Hospital in Rafah. Several people injured in the strike were brought to the medical facility just before midnight including a 4-year-old boy named Kareem Jarada and his 2-year-old sister Mona Jarada. The Kuwait Hospital said the two infants were declared dead by medics shortly after they had arrived. Video obtained by CNN shows people in bloodied clothes being pulled out of civilian cars and rushed into the hospital. Other videos show some injured people being taken out of ambulances marked with the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) symbol into the hospital on stretcher beds. Another video obtained by CNN from inside the hospital shows a doctor trying to treat Mona’s injuries. Her body appears to be covered in blood splatters with her left eye severely wounded. Her head and right leg are covered in bandages. Video shot by a journalist working for CNN in the Kuwait Hospital courtyard shows a single small body bag with the bodies of both siblings inside it and their names written in marker on the outside and their date of death – April 30 Four men are seen praying over the body bag, as the children’s grandmother Um Rami Abu-Shalab crouches over, crying. She is seen opening the bag and looking at her grandchildren, saying: “they are going to heaven.” The two lifeless heads of the children look bloodied and discolored. “Every time I saw her eyes, I’d say she has eyes like a deer’s…God give your mother strength. God rest your souls my grandchildren,” she says while sobbing. Um Rami told CNN she spoke to her daughter on Tuesday after sunset, when she told her she put her kids to bed after they played with the neighbors and had dinner. “She put them to bed and then the treacherous ones came…God will punish them,” she said. Pointing at the body bag, Um Rami told CNN they were her first and only grandchildren, calling them her “first joy”. She said their parents were injured in the airstrike and are now “between life and death.” “We are going to bury them without their parents and without most of their loved ones, because they were either injured in the attack or displaced in different areas of Gaza,” she said. Um Rami told CNN the family has been displaced multiple times by the Israeli military, but that it didn’t matter because “this is all they want, this is their goal,” she said, pointing at her dead grandchildren. The children’s aunt, Maram Abu-Shalab told CNN from the hospital that the Israeli military struck the home her sister and her family were sheltering in without giving a warning. “We’re still in a state of shock. What is one supposed to say? They are innocent. The babies went to bed last night, and they never woke up. They went to God…this heartbreak will stay with us forever,” she said. Unable to hold back tears, she told CNN that Palestinian blood has been flowing like a “waterfall that hasn’t stopped” since October 7, when Israel launched its war on Hamas following an attack by the terror group that killed more than 1,200 people. Israel’s subsequent devastating assault in the Palestinian enclave has killedmore than 34,000 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “I didn’t even have time to enjoy being called an aunt,” said Abu-Shalab. “They didn’t even have time to grow. They were so young…we are all so sad…there is nothing harder than the devastation of death, and the death of children,” she said. In response to a CNN request for comment, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) referred to a previous statement, that said “the IDF is operating to dismantle the Hamas military and administrative capabilities,” saying it “follows international law and takes feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm.” “Given the ongoing exchanges of fire, remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks. The IDF will continue to counter threats while persisting to mitigate harm to civilians,” the statement added.\n"
