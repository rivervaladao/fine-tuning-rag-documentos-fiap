            "Cyclone Chido caused extensive damage on the French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, leaving several people dead, officials said Saturday, as the storm roared toward the east coast of Africa. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said a “very provisional” tally shows there are at least “a few people” who have died. He said he would not yet provide any precise numbers of people killed and injured given rescuers have not yet been able to assess the situation on the ground. “We’re afraid the toll will be high, but for the moment I can’t give any figures,” Retailleau told reporters following an emergency meeting at the interior ministry in Paris. “The island seems devastated.” Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, ripping metal roofs off houses in Mayotte, which has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands that lie about 800 kilometers (497 miles) off Mozambique. France’s new Prime Minister François Bayrou, whowas appointed Friday, said public facilities have been “severely damaged or destroyed” including at the prefecture, the hospital and the airport. He said many people living in precarious shacks in slum areas have faced “very serious risks.” French President Emmanuel Macron said he was closely monitoring the situation. “Our island is being hit by the most violent and destructive cyclone since 1934. Many of us have lost everything,” Mayotte prefect François-Xavier Bieuville said in a Facebook post Saturday. He said the highest alert had been lifted so that rescuers can help after the worst of the cyclone had passed. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to “help the population and prevent potential looting.” Some 110 rescuers and firefighters sent to Mayotte from France and the nearby territory of Reunion have been deployed and an additional reinforcement of 140 people will be sent on Sunday. France’s poorest island, Mayotte has previously struggled with drought and underinvestment. French Transport Minister François Durovray said Mayotte airport was “badly damaged, particularly the control tower” by the cyclone in a message on X. He said infrastructure on the island had been heavily impacted and air traffic will first be reopened to military aircraft only. Ships are being used to provide supplies. Mayotte is still under red alert for the ordinary population and people were asked to “remain confined in a solid shelter,” prefect Bieuville said. Only emergency and security services were allowed to go out. Local broadcaster Mayotte la 1ere said that thousands of homes were without power, tin huts and other small structures had been blown away and many trees had been blown over. The nation of Comoros, a group of islands north of Mayotte, also was being battered by Chido and the highest alert had been announced in some areas. Authorities said they were concerned for a group of 11 fishermen who had gone out to sea on Monday and had not been heard from. Comoros authorities have ordered all ships to remain anchored in harbors and have closed the main airport and government offices. Schools were ordered closed on Friday so that people could prepare for the cyclone. Chido was expected to continue its eastern trajectory and hit Mozambique on the African mainland late Saturday or early Sunday, forecasters said. Mozambique’s disaster agency has warned that 2.5 million people might be affected in the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula. And further inland, landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe were also preparing. Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs said it was expecting flooding in some parts and urgently advised some people to move to higher ground. In Zimbabwe, authorities said some people should prepare for evacuation. December through to March is cyclone season in the southeastern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne cholera disease — as happened in the aftermath of Idai — as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in southern Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to climate change, having to deal with large humanitarian crises.\n",

            "Georgian lawmakers voted in a far-right former soccer star as the country’s next president on Saturday, deepening tensions between the pro-Russian government and pro-Western opposition amid mounting popular anger over the former’s decision to halt European Union accession talks. Mikheil Kavelashvili, 53, is a former MP for the ruling Georgian Dream party and played for the English soccer team Manchester City during the 1990s. He was the only candidate in the running. For the first time, the president was chosen not by a national election, but in parliament by a direct ballot of a 300-member electoral college made up of MPs and representatives of local government. Because the four main opposition groups have boycotted parliament since October’s disputed election, Kavelashvili was a shoo-in to win. In total there were 225 electors present for the vote, and 224 voted for Kavelashvili, who was the only candidate nominated, Reuters reported. He will be inaugurated on December 29, the news agency said. Georgian presidents holdlargely ceremonial powers. Kavelashvili is a hardline critic of the West and his upcoming presidency will no doubt exacerbate divisions between pro-Kremlin forces and pro-EU protesters, many of whom who have camped out in Tbilisi for the past 16 nights following the government’s decision to halt talks on joining the EU. Tensions have been brewing for months in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people, where critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of following increasingly authoritarian, pro-Russia policies in a turn away from the West that has tempered hopes for Georgia’s long-promised path to EU membership. Georgia’s Prime Minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, congratulated Kavelashvili at a briefing following the vote, while also describing the outgoing president, Salome Zourabichvili, as an “agent” of unspecified foreign powers, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, Zourabichvili, a pro-Western figure who has joined the opposition protesters, said the presidential vote made “a mockery of democracy.” Before the vote, she vowed to remain in office despite the result, insisting she holds the only legitimate institution left in Georgia. “I’m here and will remain – standing together with everyone!” Zourabichvili said late Friday. It is not clear how Georgian Dream will respond if Zourabichvili refuses to leave office. In an interview with CNN in October, Zourabichvili downplayed fears about her safety, saying her future “is not as important as the future of Georgia.” Critics have questioned Kavelashvili’s competence for the role, pointing to his background in sport rather than politics. He entered politics in 2016 after he was disqualified from seeking the leadership of the Georgian football federation because he has no higher education. Natalie Sabanadze, Georgia’s former ambassador to the EU, told CNN that Kavelashvili is “absolutely not qualified” and that his selection was taken by many Georgians as “an insult to the country.” “This was not just a nomination of a puppet who obviously cannot think for himself, but I think it was also a signal to Europe that… we’ll have a president which is completely opposed to the Western values,” said Sabanadze. Georgia has slid into crisis since a disputed election in October. Georgian Dream – already 12 years in office – claimed victory, but observers say the vote was neither free nor fair. The European Parliament has called for a rerun. Despite claiming earlier that his party was committed to joining the EU, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidzeannouncedon November 28 that his government would suspend accession talks with the EU, which some 80% of Georgians support joining. Meanwhile, Georgia’s relations with the EU have deteriorated sharply in recent months as Brussels has alleged that the government had resorted to authoritarian measures and adopted pro-Russian stances. Pro-EU Georgian citizens have demonstrated outside the parliament building in Tbilisi every night since November 28, despite police and masked “special forces” meting out acatalogue of violenceagainst dozens of protesters. CNN asked the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs for comment on the alleged brutality by the masked forces but did not receive a response. Georgia’s interior ministry has said that more than 150 officers have been injured during the protests, Reuters reported. Early Saturday, protesters took to the streets for a 17th day. Some were seen kicking soccer balls, seeming to mock the expected appointment of Kavelashvili. This is a developing story and will be updated.\n",

            "The Israeli military battered Kamal Adwan Hospital innorthern Gazawith heavy ground and aerial bombardment overnight Thursday into Friday, according to the director ofthe facility, who described as a “catastrophic” barrage. Israeli forces dropped bombs from quadcopters and injured at least three medical staff, including one colleague who had been injured at least twice before, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, told CNN on Friday. “Tonight was one of the most difficult nights,” Abu Safiya said on a voice message, which was punctuated by the sound of bombardment. The area around the hospital has been targeted with intense strikes this week. The scale and ferocity of the attacks blew off doors and windows on one side of the hospital, said Abu Safiya, adding water tanks “were blown away from the intensity of the explosion.” “As of now, heavy bombing persists throughout the night, accompanied by ongoing destruction of buildings,” he added. “It is a catastrophic scene, with airstrikes and artillery shelling occurring with unprecedented intensity and frequency.” Israeli forces launched an aerial and ground incursion in several parts of northern Gaza in early October, saying they were targeting Hamas’ renewed presence there. The two-month onslaught has razed streets into carpets of debris, killed entire families, and severely depleted food, water and medical stocks. The Israeli military has fired on Kamal Adwan Hospital on a daily basis, and raided the facility at least six times since October 5, Abu Safiya told CNN. The Israeli military says Hamas uses hospitals for its military operations. Hamas denies using hospitals as cover. CNN cannot independently verify either claim. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military about Abu Safiya’s accusations. On Friday, COGAT, Israel’s aid agency said that “intense fighting has been taking place in certain areas of the northern Gaza Strip between IDF forces and terrorist organizations operating in the area.” More than 4,000 Palestinians have been killed or reported missing, Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson, Mahmoud Basal, said on Tuesday, since October 5. Another 12,000 people have been injured. Emergency crews have previouslytold CNNthat the magnitude of the Israeli assault means they are struggling to access survivors trapped under the rubble of pancaked buildings. COGAT said the Israeli military had “allowed and facilitated the evacuation of patients, escorts, and staff” from Kamal Adwan Hospital, to other health centers in the northern and southern parts of the strip. COGAT added that “efforts had been made to facilitate and coordinate the delivery of supplies to the hospital, including food, water, medical equipment, and fuel.” But humanitarian agencies have warned that barely a trickle of aid has entered neighborhoods and hospitals in northern Gaza. Israel’s sustained aid restrictions have cut off between 65,000 to 75,000 trapped residents from access to food, water, electricity or reliable healthcare, the UN’s agency for Palestine refugees (UNRWA) reportedon December 12. On Thursday, the head of the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said Israeli authorities had repeatedly denied humanitarian access to Kamal Adwan Hospital, where at least 96 patients, and health staff, “urgently need support.” “The World Health Organization was denied three times in the last four days to access the hospital to deliver medical supplies and fuel; transfer critical patients to Al-Shifa Hospital; and deploy an international emergency medical team,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in apost on X. “Hostilities continue. Today a nurse was killed in an attack while he was on the way to Kamal Adwan,” he added. On Thursday, a leading orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Saeed Jouda, was killed on Thursday while traveling near Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, according to the hospital. CNN asked the Israeli military about Jouda’s death.\n",

            "A few years ago, it would have been unimaginable that Italy would be home to one of the most stable governments in Europe. Italian coalition administrations tended to last just over a yearbefore collapsing, making Italy predictably unpredictable. But a series of factors, including government crises in relatively stable countries likeFranceandGermany, and the roaring popularity of Italy’s current coalition led by far-right Prime MinisterGiorgia Meloni, in power since 2022, have made Rome the key player in Europe’s relationship with the US under Donald Trump’s second presidency. During his last term Trumpcalled Europea “foe” of the US. This time, Meloni has the potential to turn that around thanks in part to their mutual friend Elon Musk. Musk, Trump and Meloni dined together at French President Emmanuel Macron’s 60-person dinner after the official reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last weekend, an experience Trump latertold The New York Postwas positive. “We got along great,” he said, adding that he and Meloni had spent “a lot of time together.” Describing the diminutive figure (Meloni herself has often joked about her 5’ 2” height) as a “live wire,” he predicted that they could “straighten out the world a little bit.” The two leaders, while politically similar, don’t necessarily align on all the world’s most pressing conflicts. Meloni has been one of Ukraine’s strongest backers, having met with President Volodymyr Zelensky a dozen times since Russia’s invasion. Whether she can in any way affect what Trump might do, however, is hard to know, but she will have first dibs to try in Europe. “Before there is a new government in Germany and with the current situation in France, when Trump comes into the White House, Italy will have a kind of monopoly, as the only country with a stable government,” Giovanni Orsina, director of the department of Political Science at Luiss University in Rome, told CNN. “Meloni and Musk have a very good ongoing relationship, and Musk can be a kind of best friend to both, as long as the Trump-Musk honeymoon lasts at least.” Musk and Meloni forged their very strong friendship in the summer of 2023, and the Tesla founderheadlinedMeloni’s Brothers of Italy political convention, Atreju, in December last year. He is rumored to be making a surprise appearance at the same convention this weekend in Rome, which is being headlined by Argentinian President Javier Milei, another of Trump’s populist bedfellows. So close is their relationship that Meloni and Musk had to take to social media earlier this year to dispel rumors of a romance, after he gushed about her beauty when he presented her with a Global Citizens Award on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. A photo of them locked in a gaze went viral, to which Musktweetedthat he was there with his mother and that there is “no romantic relationship whatsoever with PM Meloni.” Orsina believes that Musk can make it easier for the Italian prime minister to “get in touch” with Trump whenever she feels the need. “There is an opportunity for Meloni to take the initiative and be a bridge between the Trump administration and Europe,” he said. Meloni claims to have already started that bridging process in Paris, posting a thumbs-up shot of herself with Trumpon Xwith the headline, “There is already an alliance. The USA-EU axis passes through Italy.” This is not the first time Meloni has been in the good graces of the MAGA elite. Steve Bannon was her American supporter before Musk, headlining her Atreju political convention back in 2018, telling CNN at the time that he believed she would be one of the most important politicians in Europe. Once she was elected in 2022 and became more moderate, Bannon, no longer wielding the power he once did as Trump’s chief strategist, grew cold, telling Italian newspaperCorriere Della Seralast week that she has been a disappointment. “Meloni has almost turned into a Nikki Haley,” he told the Italian daily, referring to Trump’s opponent in the Republican primaries. Citing her support for Ukraine, and what he describes as Italy’s lack of work on trade, he predicts that it won’t be Meloni who influences Trump, but the other way around. “I think her attitude will change with the arrival of President Trump, who will convince her,” Bannon said. “And that NATO countries will get on board quite quickly. Otherwise, if she really believes what she has said in recent years, she should be ready with others in Europe to put money into it, to write checks as big as the speeches. We in the MAGA movement are adamant, we want to cut funding for Ukraine in the Chamber by 100%.” For the moment, Meloni appears to be on Musk’s, and as a result, Trump’s right sides. “She is a ‘day after’ politician, much more than a ‘day before’ politician,” Orsina says, referring to the likelihood she will be reactive rather than proactive when it comes to Trump’s approach to Europe.\n",

            "In the months before Iranian ballistic missiles struck the Nevatim Airbase in October, Iran dispatched spies to film and photograph the site in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. The alleged operatives were neither highly trained nor seemed especially suspicious to the people who knew them in their day-to-day lives. Many of them appeared to struggle financially. And yet, Israeli authorities allege that the images they captured of the base provided Iran with valuable targeting intelligence. The Israel Police arrested the suspects in October, a group of seven Israelis living in Haifa, northern Israel, representing one alleged cell. They are among more than 30 Israelis arrested by Israeli authorities over the past year for allegedly carrying out missions for Iran – with the accusations ranging from photographing military bases to plotting to kill senior Israeli officials. It is an unprecedented number, according to Israel Police Superintendent Maor Goren, who oversees counterintelligence investigations. “If we go check the last years – the last decades – we can count on two hands how many people got arrested for this,” Goren said. It is a sign both that Iran has ramped up its intelligence-gathering efforts in Israel in recent years, and that – after operating for months or, in some cases, years without being detected – Israeli authorities are finally catching on to these under-the-radar activities. Israeli authorities are still uncovering more alleged Iranian intelligence-gathering efforts. Earlier this week, Israeli police arrested a 33-year-old Israeli citizen from the north who allegedly carried out tasks on behalf of Iran in exchange for thousands of dollars. The arrests have made waves in Israel in recent months. Beyond the sheer numbers, the majority of those arrested have been Jewish Israelis – a shock in a country where Jewish citizens are imbued with a deep sense of patriotism and national pride. “I wasn’t surprised – I was shocked. It was like thunder amid clear skies,” said Leonid Gorbachovsky, the next-door neighbor of the accused ringleader of the Haifa cell, Azis Nisanov. “He didn’t have anything prominent in him, nothing that would make me or anyone from our house suspect that he would be connected to something illegal. He was an ordinary man.” Gorbachovsky was home when police pried open Nisanov’s door with a metal bar and watched as police turned the apartment inside-out, finding piles of cash, he said. Like most of the other Israelis arrested on charges of spying for Iran, Nisanov had immigrated to Israel. Combined with financial struggles, intelligence experts say that an immigrant background could make the accused easier targets for Iran’s recruitment efforts. To Gorbachovsky, who moved to Israel 25 years ago from Belarus, it is unfathomable. “How can a person come to a foreign country – to Israel – from a different state and hate it?” Gorbachovsky said. “Well, if it was because of money, then this is a rotten person. How can you sell your motherland for money, even if this is big money? This is your state. How can it be?” Israeli police allege that Nisanov, an Azerbaijani immigrant, began carrying out tasks for Iran more than two years before his arrest, after being contacted by an Azerbaijani national who was working as a foreign agent for Iran. According to the indictment, the foreign agent tasked Nisanov with photographing military bases. For two years, Nisanov and six others he recruited photographed dozens of military bases, Iron Dome batteries and other strategic sites across Israel, receiving between $500 and $1,200 per task, according to the indictment. The indictment notes that several of the bases they photographed were later struck in missile attacks by Iran and its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah. While the GPS coordinates of the bases are known to Iran, Israeli authorities say the zoomed-in images Iran received from these Israelis provided additional targeting intelligence. “We can’t tell for sure if they are directly responsible for the hit, but we can say for sure that they were there before the attack… so you can say it at least helped, if not more,” Goren said. Israeli police claim Nisanov and the six others knew they were working for Iran. All seven are still awaiting trial on spying charges. They have not yet entered a plea. Nisanov’s attorney Maher Talhami did not deny that Nisanov photographed Israeli military bases, but told CNN that Nisanov “didn’t know that he was dealing with the Iranians.” “He needed a lot of money. He owed money to a loan shark, and he had really bad financial problems,” Talhami said. “He never thought that he was doing something that is harming the security of the state of Israel.” Others arrested by the Israeli police included a couple in the city of Lod in November for allegedly “conducting intelligence gathering missions” on behalf of an Iranian spying network. A police statement, quoting a senior official in the Shin Bet, Israel’s domestic intelligence agency, said that these cases “add to a series of thwarted attempts exposed in recent weeks, during which Israeli citizens operated by Iranian intelligence elements were arrested.” CNN has reached out to the Iranian government for comment on Israel’s allegations but has yet to receive a response. While many of the alleged Iranian spies were only tasked with photographing and filming strategic sites, others are accused of plotting to kill senior Israeli officials and other prominent Israelis. In August, Israeli police arrested 73-year-old Moti Maman, an Israeli from the southern city of Ashkelon, for allegedly plotting to assassinate Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar. Maman was smuggled into Iran twice and met with Iranian intelligence agents who asked him to carry out attacks against Israel, according to his indictment. Authorities allege he received payments to carry out missions on behalf of Iran. The indictment detailed Maman’s travel history as a businessman who lived for extended periods in Turkey, where he allegedly developed relations with Iranian nationals. It alleged that Maman agreed, through Turkish middlemen, to meet with a wealthy Iranian businessman known as “Eddy” to discuss business in the Turkish city of Samandag. On two separate occasions in April and May, the businessman was unable to leave Iran due to “legal difficulties,” so Maman was then smuggled into the country through a land crossing in eastern Turkey. In Iran, Maman allegedly requested an advance payment of $1 million, the indictment said. According to the indictment, “Eddy” allegedly said the plots would be revenge against the assassination of Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh on Iranian soil in July, which would prevent the outbreak of all-out war with Israel. His attorney, Eyal Beserglick, told CNN that Maman traveled to Iran for business purposes only and nothing nefarious. In another case, Goren, the police superintendent, said police arrested a man who was suspected of plotting to carry out an assassination on Iran’s behalf with a gun and 15 bullets. Iran and Israel have been waging a shadow espionage war for decades, using spies and informants to gather intelligence to carry out attacks against each other. Israel’s intelligence capabilities inside Iran are understood to be vast and Israeli intelligence has carried out multiple successful assassinations inside Iran. Following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, that silent war was thrust out in the open, resulting in the first open military attacks carried out between the two countries. Iran has also arrested several of its citizens over the last year, whom the regime and the Revolutionary Guard Corps accuse of spying for Israel or collaborating with its foreign intelligence agency Mossad, according to Iranian state media. Israeli officials and intelligence experts say the uptick in Iranian spying activity that has been exposed in Israel reflects broad-based recruitment tactics employed by Iran. Oded Ailam, the former head of counterterrorism for the Mossad, calls it “the theory of the big numbers.” “They are not really discouraged by failure,” Ailam said. “And most important, they don’t really care what happens afterwards to their assets… they say to themselves, ‘OK, if we fail, here we go to the next one.’ And they don’t really care about the outcome.” According to Goren, the police official, Israel’s Shin Bet was primarily responsible for uncovering and infiltrating the alleged Iranian spy rings, through a combination of digital surveillance and undercover operations. Israeli authorities say while some of the accused spies were recruited through intermediaries, others were approached on social media platforms, including Telegram. In a series of Telegram messages provided to CNN by Shin Bet, an alleged Iranian operative sends spam-style offers for “interesting and exciting jobs” that pay “a very high salary.” One message read: “I have various missions in the cities of Israel that not everyone has the ability to do. My missions have rewards from $100 to $100,000.” Another said: “We just need brave men. Are you brave? For a lot of money?” CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the messages. Goren said the Iranian recruiters often began by asking their targets to carry out small “test missions” for easy money, steadily increasing the seriousness of the missions and further compromising their targets. Goren said such a test mission could involve taking a picture of a building or spraying graffiti on a wall. In one series of messages provided by the Shin Bet, the target was tasked with buying gasoline to set off forest fires. “They want fast money,” Goren said of the accused spies. “They don’t care about the country, they don’t care about their own people, they just want money.” Ailam, the former Mossad official, said those who fall into the wide net cast by Iran are often “desperate people from the part of society that is usually neglected and overlooked.” Many of those arrested are also immigrants, who Ailam said may not have “the same affiliation and the same attitude towards Israel” as others. “They are much more easy prey,” Ailam said. Vyacheslav “Slava” Gushchin, alleged to be part of the “Haifa Seven,” appeared to fit this profile to a T. His neighbors said he had immigrated to Israel from Belarus in recent years, had severe financial problems and was frequently drunk. The dentist who worked next door said he was missing most of his teeth and had sought his help for infections. CNN found dozens of discarded cans and bottles of beer in the small patio in front of the apartment he rented. When he was arrested, neighbors at first thought it stemmed from a fight he had gotten into with an attendant at the nearby convenience store. None of them suspected he was allegedly spying for Iran. Gushchin’s attorney declined to comment. “He looked like a miserable low-life,” his neighbor, Riki Yazdi, told CNN, sitting alongside her husband Moshe. His arrest sent shockwaves through a neighborhood that had sought to help him, giving him food, clothes and even lending him money. “No one could believe it,” Moshe Yazdi said. “People here that know him – that also brought him food and everything – want to kill him. If he came here again, the neighbors would kill him.”\n",

            "A former South Korean defense minister was formally arrested Wednesday (local time) over his alleged collusion withPresident Yoon Suk Yeoland others in imposing martial law last week, as authorities investigate whether their acts amount to rebellion. Martial law, the first in more than 40 years, lasted only about six hours but has triggered a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others fromleaving the countryas authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It’s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received a travel ban. The Seoul Central District Court said it approved an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun on charges of rebellion and abuse of power. Kim has been detained since Sunday. Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion carries a maximum death sentence. Kim became the first person arrested over the case. He has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon’s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. Kim said in a statement Tuesday that he “deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.” He said all responsibility for the imposition of martial law rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it, saying they were only following his order. Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors’ offices in Seoul couldn’t immediately confirm the reports. The opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill Tuesday to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Yoon and other top military officials over the martial law introduction. The main opposition Democratic Party had advocated for a special counsel investigation, arguing that public prosecutors cannot be trusted to conduct a thorough investigation of Yoon, a former prosecutor-general. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly’s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim’s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon’s martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to “quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.” Kwak said he discussed Yoon’s order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military’s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country’s spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo’s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president’s order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during “wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states” and South Korea wasn’t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn’t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating “shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces,” a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Yoon avoided impeachment on Saturday after most governing party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote on Yoon’s impeachment on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon’s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament took a vote. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required.\n",

            "During his first term as US president, Donald Trump was widely seen as a friend to Taiwan, having bolstered support for the island through increased arm sales and upgraded diplomatic visits. But that goodwill was nowhere to be found on the campaign trail, with Trump repeatedly claiming that the self-ruled democracy should pay the US more for “protection” and that it had “stolen” America’s chip business. That’s why Taiwan is buckling up for what could be a far more volatile relationship with Washington, its most important security guarantor, now that Trump has clenched a historic political comeback. “I think most people are anxious,” Professor Chen Ming-chi, a former senior advisor to Taiwan’s National Security Council, told CNN.  “Because of Trump’s unpredictability, we don’t know if Taiwan will be safer or more dangerous under his second term.” What is certain, observers say, is that Taiwan will have to pay more for its own defense and step up engagement with the Trump administration to shore up American support. China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is legally required to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies Taipei with defensive weaponry. The Taiwanese government has expressed confidence in bilateral ties, citing longstanding bipartisan support for the island.  Three senior Taiwanese security officials told CNN there are clear communication channels through which both sides discuss substantive issues, irrespective of past leadership changes,  and military communication channels in  particular have “flourished.” In a statement issued after the November election, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te stressed the importance of Taiwan’s friendship with the US and said Taipei is willing to be “the most reliable partner.” Experts say Taiwan will be closely watching Trump’s foreign policy and defense appointments, his response to Russia’s war in Ukraine and his demands on allies for clues on the future of the relationship. The stakes of that relationship are higher than ever as Beijing ramps up military intimidation of Taiwan, sending fighter jets and warships near the island almost on a daily basis and launching large-scale drills to punish what it calls “separatist acts.” This week, Taiwan’s Defense MinistrysaidChina fielded its largest regional maritime deployment in decades, as it braced for expected military exercises after Lai sparked Beijing’s ire by making unofficial stops in Hawaii and the US territory of Guam. Beijing has not announced any military drills or acknowledged the large-scale deployment cited by Taipei. US officialshave saidChina’s regional naval deployments are elevated but consistent with other large exercises in the past. But one thing’s for sure: Trump is a less vocal supporter of Taiwan than Joe Biden. The outgoing president hasrepeatedly saidthe US would be willing to intervene militarily should the Chinese attack the island, before the White House would walk back his comments. The US has long been governed by a policy of “strategic ambiguity” over exactly how it would respond to an invasion of Taiwan. Trump, though, has taken that ambiguity to another level. Asked by the Wall Street Journal if he would use military force against a blockade on Taiwan by China, Trump said it would not come to that because Xi respected him and knows he’s “crazy.” Instead, he said he would slap 150% to 200% tariffs on Beijing. In an October episode of the “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, Trump hit out at America’s longtime friend, saying Taiwan doesn’t “pay us money for the protection, you know? The mob makes you pay money, right?” Taiwan’s mutual defense treaty with Washington ended in 1979 along with official diplomatic ties. Unlike South Korea and Japan, it doesn’t pay for American military forces to be based in its territory.  Still, the US is the island’s biggest arms dealer. Ivan Kanapathy, a former White House National Security Council deputy senior director for Asia who served in the Trump and Biden administrations, told CNN that Trump’s remarks are an indication Taipei should “dramatically increase spending on US weapons and training, just as it did during the first Trump administration.” “US and Taiwanese national security interests overlap significantly,” said Kanapathy. “But the United States can’t want to help Taiwan more than Taiwan wants to help itself. That’s the bottom line.” Taiwan has long procured weaponry and military equipment from the US. There is currently a backlog of more than $20 billion in military gear that Taiwan has ordered and is still awaiting delivery.  It has also been increasing its defense budget over the years. This year, the Taiwanese government proposed a record high military budget that accounts for approximately 2.5% of the island’s total economic output, far less than the 10% target Trump said Taiwan should commit to. A significant increase in defense spending, however, could be politically difficult for Taiwan’s President Lai, as his party does not have a majority in the legislature. And 10% would make Taiwan among the highest military spenders in the world, three times more than what the US spends on its military as a percentage of its economy. Trump won re-election earlier this month and has announced a proposed cabinet stacked with multiple China hawks. Trump has also repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” America’s chip business and has suggested imposing tariffs on Taiwan’s critical chip exports, which are used to power an array of modern technologies, from smartphones to artificial intelligence applications. While experts have dismissed Trump’s comments, saying Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment, the remarks have prompted jitters that Taiwan would need to move more of its critical chip supply chain to the US at a faster pace. A move like that could affect the island’s economic security and dismantle the very “silicon shield” that some say helps protect Taiwan from the threat of an invasion by Beijing. Kristy Hsu, director of the Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research, told CNN that while tariffs on Taiwan’s chip exports wouldn’t have a huge impact possible policy shifts could hit the industry hard. “If Trump is going to do something against the chips supply chain, including more rigid export controls, that may have a lot of impact on Taiwan,” she said, referring to restrictions on which countries or companies Taiwanese chip suppliers may sell to. Earlier this month, Reuters reported the US had ordered Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, to halt shipments of advanced chips to Chinese customers.  TSMC manufactures 90% of the world’s most advanced chips. The move came after TSMC-made chips were reportedly found in devices made by Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications giant sanctioned by the US in 2019. TSMC said it had not supplied chips to Huawei since September 2020, but it continues to supply other Chinese clients, prompting concerns that Huawei may still have access to these chips through other Chinese firms. In a statement, TSMC said it does not comment on “market rumor,” adding that it is “committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.” The Commerce Department declined to comment to CNN on the issue. Analysts say increasing outreach and education efforts would be key for Taiwanese chip businesses to mitigate risks as Trump begins his second term. “For Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, they have their work cut out for them,” a former senior Commerce Department official who served under the first Trump administration told CNN. “They really have to look in the mirror and say we need to do a better job of explaining to Americans about why we are a trusted partner, why our technology is superior to China, and why you can count on us.”\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/africa/mayotte-cyclone-chido-death-toll-intl-latam/index.html\n",
            "The death toll in the French territory of Mayotte fromCyclone Chidois “several hundred” and may run into the thousands, the island’s top government official told a local broadcaster Sunday. France rushed rescue teams and supplies to its largely poor overseas department in the Indian Ocean that has suffered widespread destruction. “I think there are some several hundred dead, maybe we’ll get close to a thousand. Even thousands … given the violence of this event,″ Mayotte Prefect François-Xavier Bieuville told TV station Mayotte la 1ere. He had previously said it was the worst cyclone to hit Mayotte in 90 years. Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies. The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially. Mayotte in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa is France’s poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands. Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said ″this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.” “I think the human toll is much higher,” he added. Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone’s path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale. Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country’s north who could be impacted, according to authorities there. French President Emmanuel Macron said his “thoughts” were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll “will be high,” while new Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte. Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport’s control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in. Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said. The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to “help the population and prevent potential looting.” In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power. Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled. “Mayotte is destroyed … we are destroyed,” he said. Chido continued its eastern trajectory and into northern Mozambique where it continued to cause serious damage, while farther inland landlocked Malawi and Zimbabwe warned they might have to evacuate people because of flooding. In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed. UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides. December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year. The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria. Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.\n",

            "As they were coming in for a landing, a “plume” of bad weather suddenly appeared in front of Hawaiian Airlines pilots who hit severe turbulence just seconds later. Dozens of passengers were injured. Passengers experienced a “hard jolt” and then a “free fall” sensation. One passenger crawled back to their seat during the incident. Phones, jackets and water bottles “floated” around passengers and “two hard hits” occurred during the incident. The details from the 2022 incident near Kahului, Hawaii, are described in a just-released National Transportation Safety Board final report which faults the pilots for flying over the plume instead of going around it. “We regularly train our crews on significant weather avoidance, including in-air turbulence,” Hawaiian Airlines said in a statement. “Following Flight 35, we conducted a thorough internal review and cooperated with the NTSB to understand the factors that led the aircraft to encounter stronger than anticipated and reported turbulence. We will continue to learn as much as we can from this event.” Prior CNN reporting from the incident says 36 people were injured with 20 going to the hospital. According to the NTSB’s final report,before Hawaiian Airlines flight 35, flying on an Airbus 330-299, departed Phoenix and headed for Honolulu, the captain was informed of “potential turbulence and embedded convective activity” over the Hawaiian Islands. After a mostly uneventful flight, the pilots described a “plume” appearing vertically in front of the aircraft filled with 283 passengers. “It’s building fast,” one pilot said. The crew called the lead flight attendant onboard, but within a few seconds, the airplane lurched. The lead flight attendant was never able to alert the other seven flight attendants. “Flight attendants and passengers who were not restrained were thrown upward, impacting the ceiling or baggage compartments above them, and then downward onto the floor. A passenger who had left her seat to go to the lavatory reported that she felt the airplane shake; she then ‘flew’ face first into lavatory ceiling and was ‘thrown abruptly’ onto the floor,” the report says, noting the plane experienced vertical accelerations twice the force of gravity. One flight attendant ended up with serious injuries, and three had minor injuries. A 14-month-old child was also among the passengers injured and later transported to the hospital. Investigators said prior to this flight, there were only seven reports of minor turbulence in the area, but the agency also said the National Weather Service had forecast the potential for unstable atmosphere and flying conditions, meaning the flight crew was aware of what could occur along its route. Honolulu Emergency Medical Servicestold CNNthat the patients’ injuries included a serious head injury, lacerations, bruising and loss of consciousness. One passenger was out of her seat to go to the bathroom and said she felt the airplane shake then flew face first into the bathroom ceiling before she was thrown onto the floor. She had to crawl back to her seat. The storm was later identified as a Kona storm, which brings heavy rainfall and strong winds to Hawaii from the Southwest. A voice recorder in the cockpit recorded pilots saying after the turbulence that they should have “gone around.” The NTSB lists the probable cause of the incident as “the flight crew’s decision to fly over an observed storm cell instead of deviating around it despite sufficient meteorological information” that there was the potential for severe weather. The seatbelt sign was turned on before the event. However, the captain never made another announcement about the turbulence, potentially contributing to more passenger injuries, the NTSB said. Injuries were treated by flight attendants and trained passengers. The captain had over 12,000 hours of flying time and nearly 6,000 hours on the same make and model plane. Damage occurred throughout the cabin, including a passenger service unit that fell from an overhead carrier and missing ceiling panels. More damage occurred throughout the plane, including a flight attendant handset and exit signs.\n",

            "A US serviceman was sentenced to five years in prison for kidnapping and raping an underage girl last year, an official from Naha District Court on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa told CNN. The sentence was made on the grounds that the crime was a “major sexual infringement,” Judge Tetsuro Sato of Naha District Court said on Friday, according to public broadcaster NHK. “The girl’s testimony that she told her age by gestures and other means is sufficiently credible from the security camera footage,” the judge said. “The defendant was aware that the girl was under 16 years old. The defendant was aware that the girl may have said ‘stop’ and may not have consented. Given the relationship and age difference between the two, who had never met each other, it is a crime of great sexual violation that stands out for its maliciousness.” The US Air Force member, Brennon R. E. Washington, wasindicted on March 27on charges of “non-consensual sexual intercourse” and “indecent kidnapping” after he was discovered to have taken a 16-year-old Japanese girl to his residence last December and sexually assaulting her, Japanese prosecutors said. The US military handed the 25-year-old serviceman over to Japanese authorities on the same day. He was later released on bail and transferred to Kadena for custody, a government spokesperson told CNN. His trial began on July 12. “We are heartbroken and deeply regret the damage done to the victims and their families,” Air Force Brig. Gen. Nicholas Evans, commander of Kadena Air Base, told local media on Friday. “Sexual assault is a serious crime and in no way reflects the values of US military personnel.” The incident is the latest in a history of criminal cases involving US personnel in Okinawa, home to several US military installations. It could exacerbate tensions with residents who have long opposed the presence of American troops and weaponry on the island. It also comes nearly 30 years after three US servicemen raped a 12-year-old Okinawa schoolgirl in 1995, sparking a backlash against the US military on the island. In 2016, the rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman by a former US base worker in Okinawa triggeredmass protests in the island’s capital, with tens of thousands of residents demanding the US move its bases outside of Okinawa. The fallout resulted incurfews for US personnelon the island. In another crime involving US personnel in Japan, a US Navy officerkilled two Japanese nationalswhile driving down Mount Fuji in 2021. Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters in June this year that the allegations of rape and kidnap against Washington were “extremely regrettable,” adding it was necessary “to strongly protest against the US military and other related organizations.” The governor also said his office will “take a tough stance in dealing with the situation.” “We understand and share the local community’s concerns regarding this case,” 18th Wing 1st Lt. Alvin G. Nelson III, spokesperson for the US Air Force 18th Wing at Kadena, told CNN earlier this year, adding that wing leadership was “deeply concerned by the severity of this alleged crime” and has been working with local authorities to investigate the allegations. “All US service members are expected to uphold the highest standards, and the US military is committed to holding accountable those who are convicted of criminal acts,” Nelson said.\n",

            "A wide-reaching storm boosted by anatmospheric riverwas drenching the entire East Coast Wednesday with heavy rain and strong winds. The storm’s worst sloppy mess of heavy rain and strong winds made for treacherous travel and a miserable day in the Northeast. Winds gusting 50 to 60 mph in the afternoon and evening threatened to knock out power across the region, including in New York City and Boston. “Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines. Widespread power outages are possible. Travel could be difficult, especially for high profile vehicles,” such as buses and trucks the National Weather Service office in Boston warned. More than 80,000 homes and businesses on the East Coast have lost power as of Wednesday night – including about 44,000 in Maine and 13,000 in Massachusetts, according topoweroutage.us. The atmospheric river feeding the system is tapping into the warm tropical ocean off the coast of the Southeast to create moisturelevels rarely seen in the Northeast outside of tropical systems, allowing for faster rainfall rates and the potential for flash flooding. Experts are saying this will be the most moisture-rich system in the Northeast sincelast Decemberwhen widespread flooding killed several people and caused significant damage to roads in Maine. This will be the first significant rain event for much of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast since August, so while the atmosphere is loaded with flooding rainfall potential, the ongoing drought conditions in the region, including extreme drought conditions in New Jersey, should limit widespread flooding. “The main concerns will be urban and poor drainage flooding and ponding on roadways,” forecasters with the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, New Jersey, said. The drought stems froma record warm and dry fallthat has stretched into winter. Philadelphia hasn’t recorded more than 1 inch of rain in a day since August 6. The last time New York’s Central Park had a 2-inch soaker was August 18. Still, the storm could dump a lot of rain, and quickly. A level 2 of 4 risk for flooding rain is posted from Long Island, New York, north through Maine with more than 1.5 inches of rain expected for much of the East Coast and more isolated pockets of 2 to 4 inches possible. Rapid snow melt in areas in interior New England could add to the localized flash flooding concerns, especially near smaller creeks and low-lying areas. “The rivers across New England can thankfully take a decent surge of moisture after a very dry fall, so the prospects of significant flooding are lower than normal at this point,” adds the Weather Prediction Center. Rainfall totals may not end up quite as high for areas outside of the Northeast but parts of the mid-Atlantic could encounter a few severe thunderstorms Wednesday. A level 2 of 5 risk of severe storms is in place from eastern North Carolina north along the immediate coast to southern New England, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Damaging wind gusts are the primary threat from any thunderstorm, but a few tornadoes are also possible, particulary in eastern North Carolina. Another rush of Arctic air will arrive behind this storm, dropping temperatures back below normal. Much of the Northern Plains and Midwest will wake up to below zero wind chills by Wednesday morning. This will once again trigger the lake effect snow in the Great Lakes by the middle of the week, and 1 to 2 feet of snow is possible off lakes Erie and Ontario by the end of the week.

            "In the early years of Xi Jinping’s war on corruption, the Chinese leader consolidated control over the world’s largest military by taking down powerful generals from rival factions and replacing them with allies and proteges loyal to himself. A decade on, having given the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) a structural overhaul and stacked its top ranks with his own men, the supreme leader is still knee-deep in his seemingly endless struggle against graft and disloyalty. And, like many strongman leaders in history, he is increasingly turning against his own handpicked loyalists. Late last month, Xi purged one of his closest proteges in the military – a decades-old associate entrusted with instilling political loyalty in the PLA and vetting senior promotions. Adm. Miao Hua, who sits on the Central Military Commission (CMC), the top command body chaired by Xi, has beensuspended under investigationfor “serious violations of discipline,” the Defense Ministry announced, using a common euphemism for corruption and disloyalty. As the head of the CMC’s political work department, which oversees political indoctrination and personnel appointments, Miao is the most senior scalp in Xi’s latest military purge. Since last summer, more than a dozen high-ranking figures in China’s defense establishment have been ousted, including the last two defense ministers promoted to the CMC by Xi. But none of them boast the kind of long-standing relationship Miao shared with the top leader, dating back decades to Xi’s early political career in the coastal province of Fujian. The probe into Miao opens a new front in a widening purge that hasraised questionsover Xi’s ability to end systematic corruption in the military and enhance its combat readiness at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. Over the past decade, Xi has overseen an ambitious transformation of the PLA into a “world class” fighting force that can rival the US military. A key goal of that modernization drive is to ensure China is ready to fight and win a war over Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island Beijing claims as its own. But Miao’s downfall renews questions – raised during last summer’s purges – about how much confidence Xi has in his top generals who would be responsible for leading a war, said Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at the Pentagon-funded National Defense University. “If he fears that he has brought in people who are not unquestionably loyal to him or his agenda, that would be a huge problem.” Experts say Xi’s purge of a longtime acolyte points to a familiar dilemma for autocrats, including his predecessor Mao Zedong: after eliminating political rivals, the supreme leader never stops looking for new threats to their absolute hold on power – including from their own close circle. Miao’s history with Xi goes back three decades. The Fujian native served as a political officer in the former 31st Group Army from the 1980s to the early 2000s, when Xi was rising through the ranks as a local official to become the provincial governor of Fujian. “According to credible sources, Xi regularly visited the 31st Group Army at the time” and is known to have had personal contacts with Miao, said James Char, a longtime PLA-watcher and research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Miao’s military career took off soon after Xi came to power. In 2014, he received a major promotion to become the political commissar of the PLA Navy, making an unusual switch from a career in the Ground Force. Three years later, he was promoted again into the CMC, the apex of military power. “We cannot find a more apodictic acolyte of Xi than Miao,” Char said. “If Miao is eventually indicted of graft, clearly Xi himself had not anticipated the obscene extent of corruption that exists among PLA elites.” For the past 18 months, Xi’s cleanup had largely targeted officials connected to the procurement of weapons and the Rocket Force, which oversees China’s nuclear and conventional missiles. But Miao’s downfall signals a broadening of that crackdown into new sectors, such as political work – which Xi has described as the “lifeline” of the military – and the Navy. “Wherever they look, I’m sure they will find issues and cases. It’s just a matter of which sector they pick,” Char said. The Defense Ministry has offered no details about the allegations against Miao. As the chief political commissar of the PLA, Miao is tasked with ensuring its loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. He oversees promotions in the military, vetting key candidates for their political loyalty – a role he also held in the Navy. In the past, such roles have offered fertile ground for graft, especially bribes for promotions. Miao’s predecessor, Gen. Zhang Yang,killed himselfwhile under disciplinary investigation for bribery. As the geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China heats up, the PLA Navy has also seen a drastic increase in the procurement of warships and other weapons, providing ample opportunities for corruption, said Victor Shih, a political science professor at the University of San Diego. But there could be another potential reason behind Miao’s downfall, Shih said, for “being too obvious in his attempt to foster a faction in the military.” Xi has repeatedly warned against the forming of factions in both the party and the military. “Of course, the only person who is allowed to do that is Xi himself,” Shih added. Miao is seen by some analysts as having recommended multiple associates in the Navy for promotions to key positions, including Rocket Force Commander Wang Houbin and Defense Minister Dong Jun. The announcement of Miao’s investigation came a day after the Financial Times reported that Dong had been placed under investigation for corruption, citing current and former US officials. The Defense Ministry dismissed the report as “sheer fabrication,” and days later, Dong made a public appearance at a security forum. Wuthnow, the expert at the National Defense University, said what led to Miao’s downfall was a “loss of confidence,” but the reasons for that remain elusive. In one scenario, Wuthnow said, Xi might have viewed Miao as becoming too powerful and independent, and wanted to uproot what he saw as a bastion of influence that he could not fully control. “I don’t think this is how leaders who are confident in their own power and ability to corral the bureaucracy behaves. It actually strikes me as a sign of weakness, if not paranoia, that he feels he needs to constantly overturn the apple cart,” he said. Miao’s downfall comes less than a year after former defense minister Li Shangfu was removed from the CMC. The powerful body had six members – all deemed as Xi’s loyalists – serving under the top leader when he began his unprecedented third term two years ago. If Miao is also removed, it would leave two vacant seats. Shih, the expert on Chinese elite politics, said many dictators, from former Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to Mao, have eventually turned against their own proteges. “Once all of their real competitors are gone, a dictator can never think to themselves: ‘Oh well, all the threats are gone. I can just relax.’ Because they always think that new threats could emerge, including from people who once were very close to them. This happens over and over again,” he said. As a result, the dictator is always looking for increasingly subtle signs that someone is plotting against them, said Shih, the author of “Coalitions of the Weak,” which examines Mao’s hold on power in the late stage of his life. During Mao’s last years, he turned against Lin Biao, his longtime protege, former defense minister and heir apparent, accusing him of plotting a coup. “This kind of dynamic will become increasingly severe as Xi Jinping gets older, as his health is not as robust as previously. His sensitivity to signs of potential challenge to his power will also become keener over time,” Shih said. For now, the top leader appears determined to carry on his crusade against corruption and disloyalty. Earlier this month, Xi inspected the PLA’s Information Support Force with his four remaining loyalists on the CMC. “We must ensure the troops remain absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable,” Xi told an audience of note-taking officers.\n",

            "German ChancellorOlaf Scholzfaces a confidence vote on Monday he is expected to lose, paving the way fora snap election early next year. Scholz himself called the vote, and if he loses, he will have to ask Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to dissolve parliament in a process which would trigger fresh elections. New elections must be held within 60 days of parliament being dissolved. Scholz, who leads the center-left Social Democrats (SPD),reached an agreementwith opposition parties to hold an early federal election on February 23. Last month, Germany’s governing coalition collapsed after disagreements over the country’s weak economy led Scholz to sack his finance minister, Christian Lindner, leaving him in a minority government with the Green Party. Lawmaking has largely ground to halt since the government’s collapse. Scholz initially announced that he planned to hold a confidence vote on January 15, but he came under immediate pressure from the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party to hold them sooner. Scholz’s government has grown increasingly unpopular in Germany, with Scholz also one of the least popular chancellors ever, according to a September opinion poll. If a snap election is called,pollspoint to the conservative CDU, the party of former long-serving chancellor Angela Merkel, being on track to win. The CDU is currently leading with 31% of the vote, according to a poll from Politpro, followed by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) with 18%, Scholz’s SPD with 16% and the Greens with 12%. Currently led by Friedrich Merz, the CDU alongside its Bavarian “sister party,” the Christian Social Union (CSU), has been the most dominant force in Germany’s post-war era. Merz’s campaign has focused on measures to boost Europe’s largest economy, including incentives to work and tax cuts. Germany’s economy shrank last year for the first time since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is set to contract again this year, according to the latestforecastsfrom the European Union’s executive body, the European Commission. The AfD has also made significant ground this year, becoming in September the first far-right party to win a state election since 1945 when it stunned centrist parties to win almost a third of the vote in the eastern state of Thuringia. Germany’s last snap election was in 2005. They were called by then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who subsequently lost to Merkel.\n",

            "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is expected to undergo an additional medical procedure on Thursday as part of his treatment following the emergency surgery he had Tuesday to drain a bleed on his brain. Medics from Sao Paulo’s Sírio-Libanês Hospital will perform an endovascular procedure on Thursday morning as part of his “therapy program,” according to a note released by the hospital Wednesday afternoon obtained byCNN  Brasil. The president’s doctor, Roberto Kalil, told Reuters the procedure was considered a “complement” to Tuesday’s surgery. “This involves a catheterization that targets the meninges artery. Why? Because when a hematoma is drained, there is a slight chance that the small arteries in the meninges could cause a minor bleed in the future,” Kalil said. In previous comments soon after the surgery, Kalil had said it was “important to note that (Lula) did not sustain any brain injury. The hematoma, the bleeding, was not inside the brain; it was outside the brain and has been completely drained.” Lula – who remains in the hospital’s intensive care unit – spent the “day well, without complications, underwent physiotherapy, walked and received visits from family,” the note released by the hospital says, adding that “the president remains under the accompaniment of the medical team.” The 79-year-old Lula wasoperatedon Monday due to a brain bleed linked to a fall in October. The emergency surgery added to health concerns about the aging president, a standard-bearer of the Latin American left who is halfway through his third non-consecutive term. Lula has curtailed travel in recent months while doctors monitored his recovery from trauma to the back of his head, sustained when he fell at his home in late October, requiring stitches. Prior to the emergency surgery, Lula had complained of a worsening headache during a congressional event Monday evening in the capital, Brasilia, and was taken to a local hospital for examination, presidential spokesperson Paulo Pimenta said in a radio interview. An MRI scan detected an intracranial hemorrhage, and Lula was flown to Sao Paulo soon after for the surgery, according to a medical note released by the government.\n",

            "Israelwasted no timeafter Bashar al-Assad’s fall to bomb all the Syrian military assets it wanted to keep out ofthe rebels’hands – striking nearly 500 targets, destroying the navy, and taking out, it claims, 90% of Syria’s known surface-to-air missiles. But it is Israel’s capture of Syria’s highest peak, the Mount Hermon summit, that may prove among the most lasting prizes – though officials have insisted that its occupation is temporary. “This is the highest place in the region, looking upon Lebanon, upon Syria, Israel,” said Efraim Inbar, director of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security (JISS). “It’s strategically extremely important. There is no substitute for mountains.” The summit of Mount Hermon lies in Syria, in a buffer zone that separated Israeli and Syrian forces for fifty years until last weekend, when Israeli troops took control of it. Until Sunday, the summit was demilitarized and patrolled by UN peacekeepers – their highest permanent position in the world. Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, on Friday ordered the military to prepare for the harsh conditions of winter deployment. “Due to developments in Syria, it is of immense security importance to maintain our control over the summit of Mount Hermon,” he said in a statement. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has advanced beyond the summit, as far as Beqaasem, about 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from the Syrian capital, according to Voice of the Capital, a Syrian activist group. CNN could not independently confirm that claim. An Israeli military spokesperson this week denied that forces were “advancing toward” Damascus. Israel captured the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau in southwestern Syria that abuts Mount Hermon, in the 1967 war and has occupied it since. Syria attempted to retake the territory in a surprise attack in 1973, but failed, and Israel annexed it in 1981. The occupation is illegal under international law, but the United States recognized Israel’s claim on the Golan during the Trump administration. Israel has for decades held some lower slopes of Mount Hermon, and even operatesa ski resortthere, but the peak remained in Syria proper. “We have no intention to intervene in Syria’s internal affairs,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video days after Israel bombed hundreds of Syrian targets and seized the demilitarized buffer zone. “But we certainly intend to do everything necessary to take care of our security.” Mount Hermon’s summit is a tremendous asset under Israel’s control. At 9,232 feet (2,814 meters), it is higher than any point in Syria or Israel, and second to only one peak in Lebanon. “People sometimes say in the age of missiles, land is not important – it’s simply untrue,” Inbar said. In an academic paper published in 2011, he wrote of the many advantages presented by Mount Hermon. “It enables the use of electronic surveillance deep into Syrian territory, giving Israel early-warning capacity in case of an impending attack,” he wrote. Advanced technological alternatives like airborne surveillance, he argued, was simply not comparable. “In contrast to an installation on a mountain, these cannot carry heavy equipment such as big antennas, and they can be shot down by anti-air missiles.” The peak is just over 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Damascus, which means that control of its Syrian foothills – also now in IDF hands – put the Syrian capital within range for artillery cannons. The Syrian rebel leader Mohammad al-Jolani on Saturday accused Israel of crossing “the lines of engagement” with its actions in Syria, while a group of the country’s neighbors called on Israel to withdraw its forces from all Syrian territories. After meeting in Aqaba with officials from Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, and the European Commission, Jordan’s Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of trying to exploit a power vacuum in Syria. Safadi warned that the country’s stability was a “pillar of the region’s security” and that if Israel did not respect Syrian sovereignty it risked “an explosion of the situation. Israel’s Netanyahu, meanwhile, has insisted his “hand is extended” to the new government in Syria. But in the post-October 7 world, he and other national security heavyweights have made clear they are not going to take any chances. “Mostly, it’s a comfort for us,” retired Brigadier General Israel Ziv said of Israel’s operations in Syria. “We have learned what happened in other countries when you have a terror organization that captures military equipment.” Netanyahu has also insisted that the occupation is temporary. “Israel will not permit jihadi groups to fill that vacuum and threaten Israeli communities on the Golan Heights with October 7 style attacks,” he said. His criteria for withdrawing, he said, was a Syrian force “that is committed to the 1974 agreement can be established and security on our border can be guaranteed.” It is unclear when that may be achieved. Whether the military withdraws “is a political decision,” Inbar said. “The military would love to stay there.”\n",

There’s been a whole bunch of international infrastructure projects in the news this week, with a strong focus on digging. Busy beavers and merry moles have been chattering about resurfaced plans for a$20 trillion transatlantic tunnelthat could theoretically link London and New York in just an hour using vacuum tube technology. That’s 3,000 miles of burrowing, mind, which Newsweek estimates could take the best part of a millennium if construction proceeded at the same rate as Europe’s Channel Tunnel. In plans that are actually happening, Norway broke ground last month on itsRogfast project, which promises to be the world’s longest, deepest undersea road tunnel. Elsewhere in northern Europe, the world’s longest road and rail tunnel, theFehmarnbelt Tunnelbetween Denmark and Germany, is slated to open in 2029. Southern Europe isn’t shy of a project or two, either. Construction of anew bridgelinking Greece and Turkey might be closer to getting underway, the Greek Reporter said Friday. Over near the western end of Europe, the UK is busy building one of the world’s most expensive railway projects, known as HS2 (High Speed 2), which now costs an almighty$416 million per mile. However, many people think it’s pointless. That comes a few years after the UK resurfaced plans for what would have been one of theworld’s most ambitious bridges, linking Britain and Ireland. It was to cross just a 12-mile stretch, but the waters were deep enough to submerge the Eiffel Tower. Then there was the matter of all the radioactive waste and unexploded munitions.Unsurprisingly, plans were dropped.

            "A former Chinese soccer star and coach of the country’s national men’s team has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for corruption, state media reported on Friday. Li Tie, 47, who played for the English Premier League Everton alongside Wayne Rooney in the early 2000s, is the biggest name to fall foul of a sweeping crackdown on rampant graft in China’s professional soccer league. Despite leader Xi Jinping’s vision to turn China into a “world soccer superpower,” Chinese professional soccer has been mired with poor financial decision making, deep-rooted corruption and disappointing performance. In 2022, after China’s national men’s team suffered a disappointing elimination in the preliminary stage of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the country’s anti-graft agency launched a far-reaching investigation into bribery and match-fixing in Chinese professional soccer. Li was the first among about a dozen soccer officials ensnared in the crackdown. In March, Chen Xuyuan, the former head of China’s official soccer association, wassentenced to life in prisonfor corruption. On Friday, Li was sentenced for multiple counts of bribery by a court in the city of Wuhan, state broadcaster CCTV reported. During his trial in March, prosecutors accused Li of accepting more than 50 million yuan ($6.8 million) in bribes between 2019 and 2021, when he served as the head coach of China’s national team and national select team. In exchange, he granted favors to certain players to be selected into the national team and helped certain clubs to win matches, according to prosecutors. To become the head coach, Li and the club he was coaching at the time arranged bribes totaling 3 million yuan (US$412,800) to help him secure the role, the court heard. Li was also accused of fixing matches for the two clubs he coached in Chinese leagues between 2015 and 2019, according to the prosecutors. In a documentary about the soccer sector anti-corruption crackdown aired by CCTV in January – weeks before the trial, a remorseful Li said he “deeply regretted” taking the wrong path. “When I was a player, I despised people who played fixed matches the most,” Li said during the show. But after becoming the head coach of a club, he realized it was a shortcut to improve his club’s ranking. “Achieving success through such improper means actually made me increasingly shortsighted and eager for quick results,” he said. “It became a habit, and eventually, I even started to rely on it.” China’s Communist Party-controlled courts have a conviction rate above 99 percent and it is not uncommon for state broadcasters to air confessions before trial in high profile cases. Li is considered among the best Chinese players of his generation, and one of the most recognizable names in Chinese soccer. In 2002, Li, along with star defender Sun Jihai of Manchester City, made history as the first Chinese players to play in the English Premier League, securing his status as a national sporting icon. Li made 29 appearances for Everton during his debut season in England, as part of a memorable side that included a young Wayne Rooney and former Nigerian captain Joseph Yobo. That year Li also represented China at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, the first and only appearance for the men’s team at the quadrennial tournament. Following his successful first season, Li signed a three-year contract with Everton, but his time in the first team was marred by a series of Injuries and he returned to China in 2008 after a brief but unsuccessful spell with Sheffield United. Many Chinese soccer fans had hoped that Li, once the pride of Chinese soccer, could lead the men’s national soccer team into the World Cup when he was appointed the head coach in January 2020. But Li resigned barely two years later amid an outpouring of backlash from fans over the team’s lackluster performance in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.\n",

            "Bill Belichickreceived a warm reception when he was introduced to the crowd at a University of North Carolina men’s basketball game, days after he was named as head coach of the school’s football team. Belichick was invited onto the court at halftime of the Tar Heels’ game against La Salle in Chapel Hill on Saturday, waving to the crowd and soaking up the applause. “Welcome to the Smith Center, Coach Belichick!” the Tar Heels wrote on social media, alongside photos of the 72-year-old being introduced to the crowd. Belichick is taking on his first coaching job since leaving the New England Patriots in January having cemented his status as the second most successful coach in the NFL. He won six Super Bowls during his time with the Patriots and amassed 333 career wins, the most in history behind Don Shula. He also won two Super Bowls as assistant coach with the New York Giants, on top of his six with New England. This will be Belichick’s first job in college football, something that he described as “really kind of a dream come true” in a press conference earlier this week. According to multiple reports including fromThe Associated Press, Belichick inquired about the vacant coaching position with the New York Jets before moving to UNC, though no meetings or formal discussions took place. When asked about potential future NFL vacancies, Belichick said that he “didn’t come here to leave” and has agreed to a five-year deal with the Tar Heels running through December 2029. The famed coach has family ties with UNC through his father, Steve, who was an assistant football coach from 1953 to 1955. “My dad told me this … when you love what you do, it’s not work,” Belichick told reporters earlier this week. “I love what I do, I love coaching, I love the interaction with the players, I love building a team, working with assistants, game planning, the game itself.” The Tar Heels were looking to fill their head coach vacancy after announcing that Mack Brown would not return next season following UNC’s loss to in-state rival North Carolina State.

            "Britain’s royals are getting into the Christmas spirit after attending the Princess of Wales’ annual carol concert at Westminster Abbey on Friday evening. It was Catherine’s fourth “Together at Christmas”carol service, which was themed around love and empathy this year. Kate, 42, was joined by her husband, Prince William, and their three children, George, Charlotte and Louis. Outside the historic abbey, the youngsters stopped by a “Kindness Tree” to hang messages in honor of someone in their lives who has supported them. Kate, looking radiant in a red coat adorned with a large black bow and black buttons, arrived at the London landmark ahead of her family. She was met by clergy before heading inside and chatting with some of the performers and celebrities participating in the service as well as guests. The abbey was decorated with festive wreaths complete with red ribbons for the 1,600-strong congregation, as well as Christmas trees from Windsor Great Park donated by King Charles III. The service highlighted extraordinary individuals who have demonstrated love, kindness and empathy within their communities. During the festive gathering, there were readings from British actors Sophie Okonedo, Michelle Dockery and Richard E. Grant, who read an extract from “A Christmas Carol” by Charles Dickens. The Prince of Wales and the Olympic gold medal swimmer Adam Peaty delivered readings. The service was conducted by the Dean of Westminster, David Hoyle, and featured carols sung by the Westminster Abbey choir. There were also musical performances by guests including breakout British singer-songerwriter Olivia Dean, American musician Gregory Porter and pianist Rosey Chan. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the battles that led to the end of the World War II, and five veterans involved in these campaigns attended the service on behalf of the Royal British Legion. A candle was lit by D-Day veteran Bernard Morgan, a codebreaker who landed on Gold Beach on June 6, 1944. Ahead of the carol concert, Kate penned a moving letter about love and empathy which was included with the order of service given to everyone attending. The princess wrote about vulnerability and empathy and how “in times of joy and sadness, we are all each other’s light.” She noted that “above all else” the Christmas story “encourages us to turn to love, not fear.” Acknowledging, perhaps, the challenges she and her family have faced since her cancerdiagnosisearlier this year, the princess wrote that “love is the light that can shine bright, even in our darkest times.” The front cover of the order of service was designed by British artist Charlie Mackesy. The illustration featured a group of people embracing each other as they stroll toward Westminster Abbey in the snow. Underneath is the question: “How did I help?” and the answer: “You were by my side. Which was everything.” The Westminster Abbey event will be aired on television in the UK on Christmas Eve as part of a special program titled, “Royal Carols: Together At Christmas.” Kate has been gradually returning topublic engagementsover the past few months.

Police were called to a bar in Victoria in central London – a short walk from the palace – on Tuesday evening when a festive celebration turned violent. A 24-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was arrested on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and of being drunk and disorderly, London’s Metropolitan Police told CNN. The woman, who subsequently spent Tuesday night and much of the following day in a police cell, is believed to be a maid at the palace and was on a night out with around 50 members of palace staff at the time, according toThe Sunnewspaper. She reportedly smashed some glasses and turned on a member of the bar staff. Management at the royal residence say the matter is now being investigated and that disciplinary action could follow. A palace spokesperson told theBBC: “We are aware of an incident outside the workplace involving a number of Household staff who had previously attended an early evening reception at the Palace. “While this was an informal social gathering, not an official Palace Christmas party, the facts will be fully investigated, with a robust disciplinary process followed in relation to individual staff and appropriate action taken.” The spokesperson told the BBC that the post-reception drinks, which staff went on to at the bar, were informal and had not been arranged by the palace. A palace spokesperson confirmed the statement to CNN. A spokesperson for London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed the incident to CNN in an email, saying: “At 21:21hrs on Tuesday, 10 December officers were called to a bar in Victoria Street, SW1 following reports that a customer had smashed glasses and attempted to assault a member of staff. “Officers attended and arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of common assault, criminal damage and being drunk and disorderly. “She was taken into custody and released the following evening having been given a penalty notice for disorder.”\n",

            "South Korea’sparliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol on Saturday in an extraordinary rebuke that came about after his own ruling party turned on him following his refusal to resign over his short-lived martial law attempt. It is the second time in less than a decade that a South Korean leader has faced impeachment proceedings in office and means Yoon is suspended from exercising his powers until the decision is finally adjudicated by the country’s Constitutional Court. Following the vote, which sparked jubilation among protesters outside parliament, Yoon conceded that he will “stop temporarily for now, but the journey to the future that I’ve walked with the people for the past two years should not stop.” “I will not give up,” he said in a statement shared by the country’s presidential office. “With all the encouragement and support for me in mind, I will do my best until the last moment for the nation,” he added. The country’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who will serve as acting president under South Korean law, told reporters that he would “devote all my strength and effort to stable operation of state affairs.” Kang Sun-woo, a lawmaker with the Democratic Party, told CNN Saturday that the “great democracy of South Korea will survive and will be born again” after the impeachment. The dramatic decision marks the culmination of a stunning political showdown after Yoon briefly declared martial law on December 3 and sent soldiers to parliament, where lawmakers fought past troops to enter the building and vote down the decree. Yoon’s gamble backfired spectacularly, galvanizing many in the vibrant Asian democracy to call for his removal. Opposition parties tried impeaching him a week ago – but Yoon survived after members of his ruling People Power Party boycotted the vote, saying they hoped the president would voluntarily resign instead. Yoon then doubled down – giving a defiant speech on Thursday in which he defended his martial law decision, lambasted the opposition, claimed he was trying to save the country and vowed to “fight until the last moment with the people.” Yet moments before that speech, the leader of Yoon’s party withdrew his support for the president and backed impeachment as the “only way… to defend democracy”, instructing lawmakers to vote with their conscience. Thousands of protesters gathered in Seoul on Saturday, braving the cold to call for Yoon to resign ahead of the vote, which was passed by 204 lawmakers with 85 voting against it. “He surely tried to have a war against the citizens so this is just what he deserved,” one protestor, Lim Dong Eon, told CNN outside the National Assembly building after the vote, where protesting has now turned into partying. Another protestor kept their message short, telling CNN: “Democracy is back!” Meanwhile, thousands of the president’s supporters gathered in downtown Seoul, with many waving US and South Korean flags, chanting slogans and holding up signs in support of the embattled Yoon. Yoon, who has been immediately suspended of his powers, now awaits a ruling by the Constitutional Court – one of the country’s highest courts – to confirm his fate, which can take up to six months. Acting chief justice of the Constitutional Court, Moon Hyung-bae, said in a statement Saturday that a meeting will take place on Monday to discuss the case schedule, adding that the process will be conducted “swiftly and fairly.” If confirmed, he will become the second South Korean president to be thrown out of office by impeachment afterPark Geun-hye,the country’s first female leader. The now acting president, Han Duck-soo, also faces his own political problems and is being investigated over his role in the martial law decision, adding to the political uncertainty in the weeks ahead. A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office, mired in low approval ratings and political scandals involving his wife and political appointments. Since he took office in 2022 he has also faced political gridlock with an opposition-majority parliament – which prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill. His administration cracked down what he referred to as “fake news” with police and prosecutors raiding multiple media outlets, including MBC and JTBC, as well as the homes of journalists. Yoon argued that his frustration with the political deadlock drove him to take a bold power move, surprising not only members of his own party but also many military leaders. In his late-night address declaring martial law, Yoon accused the opposition of “anti-state” activities and being in cahoots with North Korea, without providing evidence – a charge his opponents have strenuously denied. He also portrayed his act as the only way to break the political deadlock in parliament. But it wasmet with shock and angeracross the country, which remainsdeeply scarredby the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it transitioned into hard-won democracy in the 1980s. Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police. Since then, pressure on the president has grown, with police, parliament, prosecutors and the anti-corruption body launching separate investigations into Yoon on treason allegations. On Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law. The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Yoon has also beenbarred from leaving the country. Last week, South Korean prosecutorsdetained former defense ministerKim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday,accordingto the head of the country’s correctional service. On Thursday, Yoon said he had only discussed the martial law decree with Kim before declaring it. Meanwhile parliament has already impeached both Yoon’s justice minister and his police chief. Senior government officials have testified at various government hearings over the last week revealing some extraordinary details about the night of the martial law order. Special Warfare Command Commander Kwak Jong-geun testified that he received a direct order from President Yoon to break the doors of the National Assembly and drag out the lawmakers, but he did not comply. South Korea, one of East Asia’s most important economies and vital US regional ally, now faces months of protracted political uncertainty of the kind that dominated the country during the last impeachment crisis in 2016 and 2017. Then-president Park Geun-hye was ultimately impeached by lawmakers over corruption allegations, kicked out of office by the Constitutional Court, jailed and later pardoned.

            "At least five people have died after an explosion in an apartment building in The Hague, the Netherlands on Saturday, according to authorities. The blast took place around 6:15 a.m. local time,firefighters said, causing the three-story apartment building to partially collapse and set on fire. Five different apartments were affected by the explosion, they said. Police are appealing for witnesses who may have seen a car driving away from the scene at a very high speed shortly after the incident. Though the search began as a rescue operation, Jan van Zanen, mayor of The Hague said, by Saturday afternoon, it had turned into a recovery mission instead. It is not known how many people are still under the rubble, he said, but “the reality is that the chances of survival for them are slim.” “We are considering the worst-case scenario,” the mayor said. The Dutch Urban Search and Rescue service sent a rescue group to the scene on Saturday morning, including four dog handlers and a structural engineer. By 11:30 a.m. local time, the fire was nearly out and rescue dogs were searching for possible victims, firefighters said. The dogs could not search the building for long, however, because there was a risk that it could fully collapse, according to Dutchpublic broadcaster NOS. Some 40 homes have been evacuated, it reported. One man told the broadcaster that his first thought upon seeing the aftermath of the explosion was that it was due to a rocket attack. He heard a child calling for help from the rubble, he said, but was unable to reach them when people pulled him back from the fire. Forensic officers were also at the scene collecting evidence, the broadcaster said. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in apost on Xthat he was “shocked” by images of the damaged apartment building, and that he has spoken with the mayor of The Hague to offer help. The Dutch king and queen said in astatementthat their thoughts were with those affected by the incident. This story has been updated with developments.\n",

            "The founder of fashion giant Mango, Isak Andic, died unexpectedly in an accident on Saturday, the company announced in astatement. Andic served as the company’s non-executive Chairman, according to the statement signed by Mango CEO Toni Ruiz. “He dedicated his life to Mango, leaving an indelible mark thanks to his strategic vision, his inspiring leadership and his unwavering commitment to values that he himself imbued in our company,” read the statement. Catalonia’s regional police told CNN they were notified on Saturday afternoon that a 71-year-old man had fallen down a ravine of more than 320 feet in the area of the Collbató caves of Salnitre, a popular tourist destination near Barcelona. A source in Catalonia with knowledge of the events told CNN that the victim was Isak Andic. Police units were deployed to the caves and were able to retrieve the body, the police also said. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez reacted to Andic’s death, saying “All my affection, and recognition for your great work and business vision, which has turned this Spanish brand into a world reference in fashion,” Sanchez wrote on X. Catalonia’s regional president, Salvador Illa, wrote on X that Andic had left “an indelible mark on the Catalan and global fashion sector,” and praised his work for contributing to “making Catalonia great and projecting it to the world.” Andic had a net worth of 4.5 billion dollars, according toForbes. He founded the Mango brand in Barcelona, Spain in 1984. Mango is one of Europe’s leading fashion groups, according to the company’s website, with stores in over 120 markets. In 2023, the company’s sales surpassed 3.2 billion dollars. The company currently operates 40 stores in the US and plans to open 20 more next year, according to Mango’s website.\n",

            "South Korea’sruling party has thrown its support behind attempts to impeach embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol over his ill-fated decision to declare martial law that sparked a political crisis and widespread public anger in the country. The announcement came moments before Yoon delivered a defiant speech Thursday in which he attempted to justify his hugely controversial martial law decision and rejected growing calls from across the political spectrum for him to stand down. The People Power Party (PPP) had initially refused to back impeachment, hoping instead Yoon would resign from office. But its leadership said attempts to persuade him had made no progress. “We tried to find a better way than impeachment, but that other way is invalid,” party leader Han Dong-hoon said. “Suspending the president from his duties through impeachment is the only way for now, to defend democracy and the republic.” The main opposition Democratic Party is preparing a new impeachment motion against Yoon, with a vote expected as soon as Saturday. The presidentsurvived an impeachment bidlast weekend when PPP members boycotted the vote. But after his party threw its weight behind impeachment, Han said PPP lawmakers were now free to vote according to their “belief and conscience.” “I believe our party members will vote for the country and the people,” he said. The PPP’s reversal Thursday dramatically increases the pressure on Yoon and the likelihood that the next impeachment attempt will be successful. Yoon has faced mounting calls to stand down since he declared a military emergency on December 3, accusing the main opposition party of “anti-state activities,” sympathizing with North Korea and blocking legislation and budgets. The surprise late night announcement, which was blocked by lawmakers within hours, wasmet with shock and angeracross the country, which remainsdeeply scarredby the brutality of martial law imposed during decades of military dictatorship before it won a long, bloody fight for democracy in the 1980s. Dramatic scenes from that night showed security forces breaking through windows in the National Assembly to try and prevent lawmakers from gathering, and protesters confronting riot police. In the days since, pressure on Yoon has grown, with protesters and opposition figures demanding his impeachment – and support wavering evenwithin his own partyand the military. Police have launched an investigation into Yoon and other top officials on treason allegations. And on Tuesday, lawmakers approved a special counsel to investigate whether Yoon committed insurrection and abused his power by issuing martial law. Yoon has also beenbarred from leaving the country. The following day, South Korean police raided the presidential office, a presidential security official confirmed to CNN. Several South Korean officials close to Yoon have been reprimanded for their roles in the emergency declaration. Last week, South Korean prosecutorsdetained former defense ministerKim Yong-hyun, who allegedly recommended the martial law imposition and resigned in the wake of the scandal. Kim attempted to end his own life in custody late Tuesday,accordingto the head of the country’s correctional service. On Thursday, lawmakers voted to impeach Justice Minister Park Sung-jae and National Police Agency Chief Cho Ji-ho. In South Korea’s increasingly partisan political environment, Yoon has portrayed the opposition, led by the Democratic Party, of being overly soft onNorth Korea, which they deny. In his speech Thursday, Yoon portrayed his brief declaration of martial law as an attempt to break the political stalemate, while accusing the opposition of “siding with North Korea, scratching the government that is struggling to respond” to Pyongyang’s launches oftrash balloonsinto the South, illegal nuclear armament and missile threats. “I don’t know which country the party belongs to and which country the National Assembly belongs to,” Yoon said. A former prosecutor and conservative firebrand, Yoon has had a difficult two years in office. He has faced plummeting approval ratings over economic issues and aseries of scandals involving his wifeand political appointments that prompted calls for him to resign. And in recent months, gridlock in parliament had left him a lame-duck president prevented from moving forward on legislation to cut taxes and ease business regulations, as his main rivals in the Democratic Party used the legislature to impeach key cabinet members and hold up a budget bill. In his Thursday speech, a defiant Yoon sought to downplay his actions, saying the opposition was “creating a lot of false incitement to drag the president down by creating (the) crime of treason.” Yoon also claimed he declared martial law “to maintain order, not to dismiss the National Assembly nor to paralyze its function.” “If I were to paralyze the functions of the National Assembly, I would’ve enforced martial law on the weekend, not a weekday,” he said. “And cut power and water at the parliament building first, and restrict broadcasting. But I didn’t do any of that.” As his hold on the country becomes more tenuous, Yoon also pledged to “fight until the last moment with the people.” “I apologize again to the people who might have been surprised and nervous due to the short-lived martial law,” he said. Please trust in my passionate loyalty for you, the people.” This story has been updated with additional information.\n",

            "In their Upper East Side townhouse, TV power couple Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos have recreated a slice of Paris in New York. The glamorous five-story home has seen their three children grow up, but has largely remained unchanged since interior designers William Sofield and Emma O’Neill of Studio Sofield transformed the property into an Art Deco paradise more than a decade ago. Now, the co-hosts of “Live With Kelly and Mark” are opening the doors to the pristine space in theJanuary issue of Architectural Digest, giving a full tour that goes beyond the hints of chandeliers and holiday decor seen in the background of Ripa’s social media posts. While celebrity homes often have a short lifespan before being rotated out of their owners’ portfolios, Ripa told the magazine she has no desire to leave — ever. “I don’t want to sound morbid, but they’ll have to carry me out of here feet-first because I have gotten good and comfortable in this house,” she said. Ripa and Consuelos met on the set of soap opera “All My Children” in the 1990s and became co-stars once again last year, when Consuelos joined the long-running morning talk show, “Live,” which Ripa has co-hosted since 2001 alongside Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and, most recently, Ryan Seacrest. In May, the couple celebrated 28 years of marriage. When they first purchased their home in 2013, Ripa was ready to move in at first sight. “I was like, ‘It’s perfect, just hand me my toothbrush,” she recalled to Architectural Digest. But Consuelos wanted to customize the property to both their personal tastes and practical needs. The result  mixed Sofield’s version of early 20th-century French glamour with functional touches, like dual Art Deco-style armoires that keep scooters and sporting equipment hidden from view. Treasures can be spotted throughout the townhouse: 1940s dining room chairs attributed to the artist and furniture designer Maurice Jallot; a Napoleon-style secretary desk, from around 1870, in the entryway; and the bedroom sconces taken from a decommissioned ocean liner. Some rooms diverge from the Parisian theme, including the kids’ rooms (which have been kept unchanged, even though they’ve now left the nest), and Consuelos’ cigar room, which boasts black leather couches, dark walls and a backlit bar with velvet curtains. But Ripa said, when it comes to interiors, she is drawn to theatrics. “I’ve spent my life growing up on sets,” Ripa said. “So I like a bit of dazzle. Give me a show.” Nowhere is this more true than in the main bathroom, where Ripa recreated some movie magic in the form of a white chaise lounge, inspired by the 1981 film “Mommie Dearest”. “There’s an amazing scene where Faye Dunaway, playing Joan Crawford, is lying on a white satin chaise in her dressing room, putting lotion on her elbow,” she told Architectural Digest, complete with a dramatic demonstration. “I had Bill (Sofield) make me an identical replica of it!” Ripa insisted on hammered satin for the piece, and Sofield’s warning against the decision soon proved to be sage. “I sat down on the chaise to apply some lotion, kind of as a joke, but when I put my leg down I basically destroyed the entire surface,” she recalled. She later had it reupholstered in cotton silk, to which Ripa said: “I learned my lesson.”\n",

            "Notre Dame, the treasured Gothic gem in Paris that went up in flames in 2019, will officially reopen Saturday. Immediately after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious pledge to restore the church within five years. On Friday, he praised hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists for helping him “keep this promise” during his final site visit. “You did it. And it’s an immense source of pride for the entire nation. I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you,” Macron said. Here’s everything you need to know about the days ahead. On April 15, 2019, Notre Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the blaze remains a mystery. Investigators say it was likely an accident – perhaps a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction. France – and much of the world – despaired as the 860-year-old cathedral’s roof caved in, strewing the stone floor below with soot. Macron called it a “terrible tragedy,” and pledged to rebuild the landmark church “because it is what our history deserves.” Some of the country’s richest businessmen pledged hundreds of millions of euros towards the restoration. After more than 2,000 days’ work – involving 2,000 people, 2,000 oak trees and 2,000 features restored or rebuilt – the world got its first glimpse of “Our Lady of Paris” last week, as the French president toured the restored landmark with his wife, Brigitte, and a cluster of clergymen. The official reopening begins with a ceremony on Saturday, followed by eight days of special masses and prayers. The guest list will be long and illustrious, but the most notable attendee will be Donald Trump. The US president-electannounced this weekhe will travel to Paris – his first overseas trip since last month’s election – for what will be “a very special day for all.” The ceremony is expected to draw some 50 heads of state and government. One noteworthy absentee, however, will be Pope Francis. The pontiff will travel to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on December 15, just days after the reopening, but is skipping a visit to the capital. A leading French archbishop said the “star” of the ceremony ought to be Notre Dame itself, and that the pope did not want to distract from the occasion. Some 170 bishops from France and around the world will also be involved in the ceremony, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral at around 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). The Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich will then strike the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff. Once the doors open, the cathedral “responds” to the knock by singing Psalm 121 – which begins “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills” – three times. After this, the doors will open. The ceremony then proceeds in three parts. First, the “awakening” of the great organ – the largest in France, comprising 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Second, the “chanting of the office” – a series of psalms and prayers, including the Lord’s Prayer. Then, the archbishop will give a final blessing and the choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn. The service will be followed by a broadcast by France TV, chronicling the cathedral’s rebuilding. The inaugural mass will be held Sunday morning at around 10.30 a.m. (4.30 a.m. ET), with Macron in attendance. After blessing the holy water, the archbishop will sprinkle it over the congregation and then the altar. The biblical readings given at mass will be the same the world over, marking the second Sunday of Advent. A second mass will be held on Sunday evening, which will be open to the public. For the eight days after the reopening, masses will be held twice daily, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these services will be open to the public. On December 17 and 18, the cathedral will host concerts of Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Magnificat.” The cathedral expects to welcome up to 15 million visitors each year. For now, visiting remains free. Guests will be able to book a free ticket online and access the building either on the same day or one or two days after booking.\n",
            "https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/15/sport/travis-hunter-heisman-trophy-college-football-spt-intl/index.html\n",
            "One of the rarest qualities in all of team sports is the ability to impact a game in multiple ways. Athletes are seldom able to sway contests both offensively and defensively to an equal degree and those who are – referred to as two-way players – become some of the most highly coveted stars in their respective professions. The term two-way player has become everyday parlance in various sports when referring to greats such as basketball’sGiannis Antetokounmpoor baseball’sShohei Ohtani, but it is incredibly unique when it comes to football. Only a handful of players have carried out multiple roles on the football field, likeDevin Hester, Deion Sanders and Julian Edelman. Now,Travis Hunteris the latest to prove that one can excel on both offense and defense. The newly crowned Heisman Trophy winner has starred for the Colorado Buffaloes on both sides of the ball in equal measure during a remarkable collegiate season. Playing at both wide receiver and cornerback, Hunter has put together a year for the history books, which culminated in joining the select few to win the Heisman Trophy. The Buffaloes star has been a revelation on both sides of the ball throughout his time in Colorado and this season he has taken his game to the next level. “There have been guys who have played both sides, though honestly not many that have done it full time, but not at this level,” Stewart Mandel, editor-in-chief of college football at The Athletic, toldCNN Sport. “He is one of, if not the, best cornerbacks in college football and he’s a 1,000-yard receiver, it’s incredible.” Hunter’s unique ability to create an impact on any given snap is what has separated him from the rest of college football during the season. The Colorado stand-out averages a barely believable 118 snaps per game, perPFF. These are spread out evenly across both his roles with Hunter playing 709 offensive snaps on the season alongside 713 defensive snaps. “It’s incredible just that he plays that many snaps a game, much less at such a high level,” Mandel added. Hunter led the Buffaloes in receptions and receiving yards this season, amassing 1,152 yards on his 92 receptions. Unsurprisingly, he also leads the team in touchdowns with 15, including one rushing touchdown. While doing all of this offensively, the 21-year-old has also imposed himself on the defensive side of the game. Hunter had four interceptions and broke up 11 passes during a season in which he cemented himself as an elite defender. Mandel believes that Hunter’s extraordinary ability to play both sides of the ball in this fashion led to his Heisman success, and disputes the critics who believe Hunter is purely winning the award because of his snap count. “His primaryand what he was known for was cornerback, and receiver was just the other thing,” Mandel says. “He’s the number six receiver in the country, (with) 1,152 yards, and he’s a lockdown cornerback who’s had at least a couple of interceptions this season that were game-changing plays. “So, absolutely a standout on both sides.” This becomes even more evident from the haul of awards Hunter has picked up. He was named Associated Press (AP) player of the year on Thursday, as well as receiving the Chuck Bednarik Award for defensive player of the year and, just hours later, the Fred Biletnikoff Award for receiver of the year. One of the keys to harnessing Hunter’s immense ability has been playing under Sanders – also now known as Coach Prime – a former two-way player in his own right and current Colorado head coach. “Coach Prime was the only coach who would consider allowing me to do what I’m doing,” said Hunter,per The AP. “He did it and knows what it takes – how much you have to be ready on both sides of the ball.” In his Heisman Trophy acceptance speech, Hunter said that Sanders had “changed my life forever,” and his relationship with the coach has been a key factor in the success of Hunter’s college career. He made NCAA headlines before even stepping onto the football field when he shockingly turned his back on committing to the Florida State Seminoles in favor of the Jackson State Tigers. The reason for doing this was simple: Coach Sanders. “It starts with the fact that Travis Hunter was the No. 1 recruit in the country, he was expected to go to Florida State for a year, and on signing day, he shocked everybody,” Mandel says. “Clearly, he set out in college football to specifically play for (Sanders) and followed him to Colorado when he got that job.” Speaking to the coach was enough to persuade Hunter to follow Sanders to Jackson State, a HBCU and FCS school with far less football pedigree than Florida State, and then to Boulder and the Buffs. “When I first talked to him, it was like, ‘I don’t care who he is, I don’t want to go there,’ but as I talked to him more, it’s like, ‘Oh, this might be the place I want to go.’ You know, he’s more than just a coach – he’s a father,” Huntertoldthe Pivot podcast. Mandel said it is clear that Sanders, who he considers the greatest cornerback ever, has had a huge influence on Hunter’s development. This partnership has been key in helping to maximize Hunter’s vast ability and there has been no bigger supporter of the Heisman winner’s desire to play both sides of the ball than his coach. “He’s the best player in college football,” Sanderssaidafter the Buffaloes’ 52-0 win over Oklahoma State. “Travis Hunter proved today, and he’s proved every week, that he is the best player in college football.” There was only ever one Heisman winner in the eyes of Coach Prime. “Travis is him. Travis is that dude. Nobody could deal with him on either side of the ball,” Sanders added. Sanders’ son and Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders also had no doubts about who he felt deserved to win the prize. “It’s no argument at this point,” the quarterback told reporters after the win against Oklahoma State. It is obvious, too, that Hunter has no regrets in following his coach to Colorado via Jackson State. “I texted him a couple of games ago, I was like, ‘Coach, you changed my life forever.’ Just being able to see where I am at now. I don’t know where I would have been at if I went to Florida State,” Hunter said on The Pivot. Hunter is widely expected to be a high pick in next year’s NFL Draft and debates have already started about his ability to compete as a two-way player in the NFL. “I want to play both sides of the ball,” Hunter told the Pivot. “A lot of people told me I couldn’t do it at the college level and I ended up doing it. I know there’s going to be a lot of people telling me I can’t do it in the NFL and I’m going to end up doing it.” Mandel also believes in Hunter’s ability to do so at the highest level of football. “I don’t see why not,” he said while also pointing out the difficulties of juggling both positions. “It would be remarkable, but he’s done it for 12 games a year in college and college football has limits on how much guys can practice – 20-hour-a-week limits. There are no limits in the NFL, so I think he could do it.” Whether Hunter will be able to succeed on both sides of the ball in the NFL is yet to be seen, but Mandel believes whoever drafts the phenom should be excited. “At the very least, you’re getting a guy who could be an All-Pro cornerback and that’s a big deal,” Mandel said. “And you might be getting a guy who can also play receiver for you, you’re getting two players in one. “I think there’s a reason he’s expected to go No. 1. No. 1’s usually a quarterback, but you have such a rare talent in Travis Hunter that a team will probably make him the No. 1 pick in the draft.”\n",

Using content to train AI has become a major issue as the technology booms. On X,artists and others in creative rolesare fretting about their work being used – not just on X – to train computers that could someday replace human creators entirely.OtherX users say they are concerned about personal information in their tweets being used that way.

And if users have any issue with those terms, they may end up in a federal courtroom that isfavored by conservative activistsand is already presiding overtwolawsuitsinvolving Musk-owned X. According to the update, all disputes related to the terms will be brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant County is more than 100 miles away from X’s new headquarters outside of Austin, Texas. X’s terms said any users who continue to use their products or services on or after November 15 would be agreeing to the updated terms.

But it’s not clear whether X’s new terms of service take away that option. X can now license all the content on the platform, including using it in its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. While such broad licensing with few limitations is not uncommon for a social media platform, Alex Fink, CEO and founder of Otherweb, an AI-based news reading platform that targets misinformation, told CNN that what makes X unique is that its new terms “remove any ambiguity” in contrast to other platforms that don’t spell out their intentions. Before, X said posts from private accounts would not be used to train Grok. But the language in the new terms of service does not differentiate between the types of accounts.

            "The Taliban’s refugee minister was killed in a suicide bombing carried out by ISIS in the Afghan capital Kabul on Wednesday, according to officials. Khalil Haqqaniis the uncle of current Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, who leads the powerful Haqqani network, a division of the wider Taliban organization. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber disguised himself as a visitor to the Ministry of Refugees compound, detonating his bomb as Haqqani was signing paperwork, a ministry spokesperson told CNN. Six other people were killed, Reuters reported, citing his nephew. In a statement posted by the Taliban, a spokesperson said that the group received the news of Haqqani’s death with “profound grief.” The Taliban blamed ISIS for the “cowardly attack,” calling the terror group a “faction that deceitfully professes Islam while declaring other Muslims to be infidels.” ISIS is yet to claim the attack. Haqqani is the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since theTaliban returned to powerthree years ago. “We lost a very brave Mujahid,” his nephew Anas Haqqani told Reuters, using the Taliban’s term for its fighters. “We will never forget him and his sacrifice.” In 2011, the United States classified Khalil Haqqani as aSpecially Designated Global Terrorist, offering a reward of up to $5 million for information related to him. He is also on the United Nations Security Council’s1988 Sanctions List. The Haqqani network has carried out a string of major attacks during the country’s war and tensions have emerged between it and the Taliban. Designated aForeign Terrorist Organizationby the US and encompassed under the Taliban umbrella, the network maintains its own distinct lines of operation, according to theInstitute for the Study of War. The tensions between the Haqqani network and the rest of the Taliban are largely due to differences in governing strategy, according to the UK-based think tankChatham House. While ministers in Kabul appear keen to engage with the international community, Taliban leaders in Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second city, are unwilling to liaise with outsiders, Chatham House says. Sirajuddin Haqqani even reached out to the West to ask for border force training, it claims, while leaders in Kandahar fear that cooperation with western countries will antagonize their supporters.

Bawumia said in his concession speech on Sunday morning that internally collated results showed that “Mahama has won the presidential election decisively,” ahead of a formal announcement by the electoral commission. Bawumia said the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) party had also won the parliamentary election. He said he conceded “to avoid further tension and preserve the peace of our country.” “I have since called H.E John Dramani Mahama to congratulate him as President-elect of the Republic of Ghana,” Bawumia said, adding that “the people have voted for change at this time, and we respect that decision with all humility.” Opinion polls had predicted a first-round victory for Mahama amid widespread discontent over the country’s economy anda crisis overillegal gold mining. Ghanaians have been railing against environmental degradation caused by unlicensed small-scale mining, a longstanding issue that has left large swathes of land pockmarked by pits and major rivers polluted. Ghana is also grappling with its worst economic situation in decades as it reels from high inflation, youth unemployment, and a steep increase in the cost of living. Bawumia, 61, a UK-trained economist who chaired the nation’s economic management team, faced criticism ahead of the elections over his handling of the struggling economy.

            "An Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed an Al Jazeera photojournalist on Sunday – exactly one year to the day after an attack killed one of his colleagues. Ahmad Al-Louh, 39, and four other people were killed by the strike that targeted an office of the Civil Defense service in central Gaza’s Nuseirat Camp area, according to Al Awda Hospital, which treated the casualties. Al Jazeera has condemned the attack, saying Al-Louh was “brutally killed” while covering the service’s attempt to rescue a family that had been severely injured in an earlier bombing. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had targeted the Civil Defense offices in a “precise strike,” claiming the site was being used as a “command-and-control center” by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists who were planning an “imminent terror attack against IDF troops.” It said Al-Louh was among those killed in the strike and alleged he was a “terrorist” who had previously served with Islamic Jihad. The IDF did not provide any proof for their allegations. In late July, an IDF strike killed Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul, who it accused of being a Hamas member – an allegation the network slammed as “baseless.” CNN has reached out to Al Jazeera about the IDF’s allegations about Al-Louh. CNN footage shows ambulances taking the casualties to the hospital. Some of them are still wearing civil defense vests. It shows one motionless body being carried on a blanket being used as a makeshift stretcher. It also shows Al-Louh’s body on the floor, press vest draped over him, as people surround him. His brother Sajed leans over Al-Louh crying, “Hamada! Oh God,” addressing his deceased brother by nickname. According to the hospital, the other people killed in the strike were three Civil Defense workers and one civilian. A spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense strongly denied the IDF’s claim of a terrorist presence at the site. “These teams work around the clock to rescue people. Everyone knows that the Civil Defense organization is a humanitarian body that provides services during both peace and war to civilians and has no political involvement. The team was directly targeted,” said Zaki Imad Eddine. Al Jazeera, which has in the past accused Israel of systematically targeting its journalists – a charge Israel denies, described Al-Louh’s killing as a crime and said it followed a pattern of attacks in which its workers had been killed or injured by Israeli attacks. It noted that Al-Louh’s death coincided with the first anniversary of the killing of one of its cameramen, Samer Abu Daqqa, who died on December 15, 2023, after sustaining injuries in anIsraeli attackon southern Gaza. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Abu Daqqa was the first Al Jazeera journalist to have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war since the October 7 terror attack of 2023. Since then, a string of other journalists with the network have been killed or injured in Gaza, in disputed circumstances. On Sunday, Al Jazeera extended its condolences to Al-Louh’s wife and family, adding that just days earlier an Israeli strike had destroyed his house in the Da’wa neighborhood of Nuseirat Camp. The network also said it was committed to pursuing “all legal measures to prosecute the perpetrators of these crimes against journalists” and urged international legal institutions to take “urgent measures” to hold the Israeli authorities to account and “to put an end to the targeting and killing of journalists.” Israel’s military has in the past said it “takes all operationally feasible measures to protect both civilians and journalists” and that it “has never and will never deliberately target journalists.” The Committee to Protect Journalists says the Israel-Gaza war has killed more journalists in a year than any other conflict the group has documented. At least 137 journalists have been killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel and Lebanon since the war began, according to the CPJ, making it the deadliest period for journalists since it began collecting data in 1992. Of those killed,129were Palestinian. According to Gaza’s government media office, at least 196 journalists have been killed. Mohammad Al Sawalhi, a stringer for CNN in Gaza, said Al-Louh was well-known among journalists in Gaza and was often embedded with the Civil Defense in his capacity as a journalist, covering rescue missions. “He was a very fun person to be with, he always tried to help everyone and bring joy to everyone’s face,” Al Sawalhi said. “He had a great relationship with all journalists, helping them all because he knew central Gaza very well.” Al-Louh was just one of dozens of people killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday. At least 15 people were killed early Sunday when an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering displaced people in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza, according to the Civil Defense. Eyewitnesses reported 10 to 15 charred bodies after fires caused by “intensive Israeli bombing” at the Khalil Awida school, which was sheltering about 1,500 displaced people, the Civil Defense said. The IDF said it had carried out a “targeted raid on a terrorist meeting point in the Beit Hanoun area.” In Deir al Balah, a strike on tents killed four people and a strike on a family home east of Gaza city killed six, according to the Civil Defense. Meanwhile in the south, Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said 12 people were killed in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.\n",

            "A California couple visiting Mexico for the holidays was shot and killed on Wednesday when armed gunmen fired on their vehicle, according to authorities. Rafael and Gloria Cardona were visiting family in Angamacutiro, Michoacan state at the time of the attack, a US official told CNN. The woman died at the scene and the man died shortly after in the hospital. Their three children, two of whom are minors, were not present during the shooting and are currently with extended family in Angamacutiro, the US official said. The US State Department is in contact with their adult daughter. Rafael Cardona’s brother-in-law is Hermes Arnulfo Pacheco Bribiesca, a Mexican government official in Amangcutiro who assumed office after the kidnapping and murder of his predecessor in late October, according to the US official. According to a statement Rafael Cardona’s brother, Cesar, gave to local police, the couple were driving Hermes’ van when they were killed, the US official said. The motive for the attack has not been confirmed by Mexican authorities. The couple had arrived in the Pacific coast state on November 30, local authorities said earlier. In a statement sent to CNN, a US State Department spokesperson confirmed the death of both US citizens and offered their “sincerest condolences to their families for their loss.” “We are closely monitoring local authorities’ investigation into the reported killings,” the spokesperson said. A mass will be held in Angamacutiro Saturday to commemorate the couple, local authorities said. The municipality has canceled all celebrations for the rest of the month, authorities added. Michoacan has been long affected by gang violence, with cartels moving into the state in the 1980s. Its homicide rate today is more than twice the country’s average. Nationally, Mexico’shomicide rateis among the highest in the world. The state is alsoMexico’s largest grower of avocados– a market long troubled by violent groups and corrupt public authorities, researchers at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said in a report this year. Nearly three-quarters of Mexican avocados come from Michoacán. Gangs such as the Zetas and Familia Michoacana were formed in the state, which has become home to drug production and drug traffickers who target local farmers to cultivate marijuana and other drugs, according to areportfrom Insight Crime. More than 100,000 people remain missing in the country,with no explanation of their fate. According to think tankMexico Evalua,around 95%of all crimes nationwide went unsolved in the country in 2022.

            "One protester said his jaw was broken as masked men threw him to the ground, stood on his face and jumped. Another man told CNN he had a bone fractured at the top of his spine. Some, trying to document the violence, said they had their cameras smashed or stolen, before being beaten themselves. A week of fierce demonstrations inGeorgiahas seen special forces violently handling protesters who are challenging the government’s controversialdecisionto delay its bid to join the European Union. The former Soviet republic has known protests before, but many say these are larger and more vicious. Many Georgians feel they are on the cusp of returning to theone-party rulefrom which they escaped a generation ago and say they will protest for as long as it takes, despite the ruthless response. Watchdogs say that many of the scores of people arrested over the past week have been subjected to brutal treatment by police and special forces. CNN spoke to 10 protesters, including five journalists and an opposition politician, who said they were beaten by special forces – masked, unidentifiable men. They suffered injuries, they said, ranging from cuts and bruises to broken bones that left some hospitalized. CNN has asked the country’s Ministry of Internal Affairs for comment on the alleged brutality by the masked forces but has not received a response. Tensions were simmering in the country since a disputedelectionin October. The ruling Georgian Dream party – already 12 years in office – claimed victory, but observers say the vote was neither free nor fair. The European Parliament has called for a re-run. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced on November 28 his government would suspend accession talks with the EU, which some 80% of Georgians support joining. His Georgian Dream party had even made joining the bloc a constitutional commitment. Within hours, thousands descended on the parliament in the capital, Tbilisi, to demand the government honor its promises. Aleksandre Keshelashvili, a journalist for local outlet Publika.ge, told CNN he arrived at the protest in the early evening. He watched as Salome Zourabichvili – the country’s pro-Western president, in a standoff with her own government – confronted a wall of police, knocking on their riot shields and asking: “Who do you serve, Georgia or Russia?” Later, the police were bolstered by dozens of masked men. Although they have been present at protests before, their numbers were far greater this week, demonstrators said. Unlike ordinary police officers, these men do not wear uniforms showing their department and rank. “They don’t have any identifiable signs,” Keshelashvili said. Some of them confronted Keshelashvili as he stood by the parliament with other journalists. Suddenly, he said, they pulled him away from the group and began to beat him. “I was shouting, ‘I’m a journalist,’” Keshelashvili said, adding that he tried to explain he was just doing his job. Next, he was thrown into what he described as a “beating corridor”: Around a dozen men punched him, then kicked him when he fell to the floor. He said he lost consciousness. When he awoke, both of his cameras had been stolen. “We are not a very big media outlet. We don’t have much money to buy these things,” he said. After being taken into custody, Keshelashvili said he would have spent a night in a cell, if a doctor had not seen him and said he needed urgent surgery. His nose had been broken in several places. Down the street, more violence was unfolding. Guram Rogava, a presenter with Formula TV, was broadcasting live outside the parliament, reporting on the police response as it ramped up around him. After finishing his shot, Rogava began to move towards a sidewalk. When his back was turned, a masked man was seen running behind him and striking the back of his head. Rogava collapsed. “I don’t remember anything,” he told CNN. Only by watching a video of the incident did he learn what had happened to him. Rogava was seen with blood streaming down his face as his colleagues tried to help him. He later learned he had fractured a cervical vertebra in his neck. His doctor said if the bone moves much more, “I could lose control of my hands and legs.” Zourabichvili said journalists have been deliberately targeted. Multiple reporters told CNN they faced the worst violence on the first two nights, and that government forces have since backed down slightly. To some, this suggested orders from above. Aka Zarkua, a journalist at RealPolitika, said the fact that reporters were largely left alone on Sunday night suggested “when they were beating journalists, it was a clear edict from the police riot chief. It was politically motivated.” Some have said journalists may have been targeted to prevent evidence of police brutality being documented. Mariam Nikuradze, a reporter at OC Media, said the special forces get “angry” when they see their actions being filmed. But even if evidence is collected, she said it counts for little in Georgia’s legal system. “Over the past few years, I’ve been to so many trials. The courts are so biased that no matter what kind of evidence you present there, they just make political decisions,” Nikuradze told CNN. Before trial, conditions in custody are grim. The Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, a watchdog, said most individuals arrested on Monday had been “brutally beaten… both during and after their arrest.” Erekle Loladze, a winemaker, said he was beaten while being driven in a police van into custody. Before, he had been swarmed by dozens of masked men in a back alley near the parliament. “They kicked me all over my body, and at one point, someone stood on me with both feet and jumped,” Loladze told CNN in writing. His jaw was broken in two places, leaving him unable to speak. Once in court, cases are seemingly rushed through. Shota Murtskhvaladze, who works in education, said his case was heard overnight Sunday. He asked to postpone the trial, so he could collect video footage from shops near where he was assaulted by special forces, sustaining a minor injury to his face. His request was denied. He was only allowed to bring one witness, despite several of his friends seeing the attack. He said he was fined 3,000 lari (about $1,000) for not complying with a police order to disperse. Critics are troubled by the government’s growing reliance on these special forces to try to stem protests. “They have no numbers of identification, which is contrary to any international rule,” Zourabichvili told CNN. Elene Khoshtaria, one of the leaders of the opposition Coalition for Change party, told CNN these forces comprise “specially trained, huge men who look more like wrestlers than policemen.” Shortly before he was assaulted, Rogava had interviewed Khoshtaria on live television. Khoshtaria herself was later attacked multiple times by special forces. She said they “clearly” knew who she was, telling her, “Elene, go away, stop, f**k you” as they grabbed her by the hair and led her away. In a later clash, she fell to the ground, fracturing her hand. On Wednesday, opposition co-leader Nika Gvaramiawas detained by policeafter he was beaten unconscious by officers in the capital Tbilisi, his party said. Gvaramia represents the Droa party, the party that Khoshtaria founded. Although the use of special forces is troubling, Khoshtaria said it is a sign of the regime’s weakness. Unlike fully-fledged autocratic states like Belarus, she said Georgian Dream does not have enough police willing to mete out violence against civilians so they rely on a few hundred masked men instead. With the protests now raging every night for a week, Khoshtaria said the opposition movement is in a battle of endurance with the government and its agents. “They are exhausted,” she said of the government. “They thought that there would be a small crowd of people in front of the parliament. What they got is the whole of Tbilisi coming out – and also in the regions.” Although some of the protesters are too injured to rejoin the movement, many said the violence they have faced will not deter them. Giorgi Gamgebeli, a freelance photographer, said he sprained his ankle in a clash with police, which also left him unconscious. Will he be returning to protest? “Of course,” he told CNN, waving his crutches in the air.\n",

            "Russia launched a widespread attack onUkraine’senergy infrastructure overnight, forcing the country to implement emergency power outages, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday. “The enemy continues its terror. Once again, the energy sector across Ukraine is under massive attack,” Ukrainian energy minister German Halushchenko said on his official Facebook page. The extent of the damage had yet to be clarified, he said, while urging people to remain in shelters. Streets in the capital Kyiv remained largely empty Friday morning as Ukraine’s air force warned of the threat of ballistic and cruise missiles potentially targeting parts of the country. Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s energy grid operator, said power facilities in several regions were damaged and it was introducing emergency power outages across the country. Russia has launched 12 “massive” attacks on Ukraine’s power system so far this year, Ukrenergo said. Moscow’s forces have intensified bombardments of Ukraine in recent months, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to strike Ukraine again with a new nuclear-capableballistic missilefollowing awidespread attackon critical energy infrastructure that left more than a million households in Ukraine without power. Russia’s latest assault comes after Moscow vowed on Thursday to respond to a Ukrainian attack on a city in southwest Russia, which Russia claimed involved six US-made ATACMS ballistic missiles. Ukraine acknowledged making “tangible hits on Russian targets” Wednesday, including military and energy facilities, but has not said what type of missiles were used. Meanwhile, Russia continues its ground assault on the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, advancing in the areas surrounding Kurakhove and Pokrovsk, according to reports from the ground and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank. The Russian defense ministry claimed on Friday that it had captured Zarya village, to the south of the key eastern city of Pokrovsk. Russian forces are just three kilometers (1.9 miles) from theoutskirts of Pokrovskafter making advances Wednesday, the Ukrainian mapping service DeepState said earlier this week. “The losses of the Russian occupiers in the Pokrovsk direction are consistently high, especially in manpower,” Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said Friday. He also acknowledged that “for several months now, the Pokrovsk direction has been one of the most difficult in the context of the confrontation with the Russian occupiers.” NATO headMark Rutteon Thursday called for a shift to a wartime mindset - with much higher defense spending - warning the US-led transatlantic alliance that it was not ready for the threats it would face fromRussiain the coming years, Reuters reported. Rutte said future spending would have to be much higher than the current alliance target of 2% of national wealth as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). “During the Cold War, Europeans spent far more than 3% of their GDP on defense,” Rutte said in a speech in Brussels. “We are going to need a lot more than 2%.” “Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,” Rutte said. “It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defence spending.” His comments come as US President-elect Donald Trump has called for allies to spend 3% of GDP on defense. The US on Thursday announced a $500 million aid package for Ukraine in the coming days that will pull equipment out of US military stocks. The Biden administration is working to surge deliveries ofweapons to Ukrainein its final days in office in a concerted effort to put Kyiv on a strong footing going into 2025, according to a senior administration official. In November, Biden authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia. Kyiv has used the newly granted powers to fire US-madeATACMS missilesat Russian targets across the border on multiple occasions. Trump has said he “vehemently” disagrees with allowing Ukraine to use US-provided weapons to strike inside Russia, and that by doing so the US is “escalating this war and making it worse.” On Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lauded his comments, saying Moscow has the same view of the causes leading to the escalation of the conflict. When asked about Russia’s hopes for the war to end after Trump takes office, Peskov said in a press briefing that the Kremlin will wait and see after the inauguration.\n",

            "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was recovering in an intensive care unit on Tuesday, doctors said, after being rushed to a Sao Paulo hospital for emergency surgery to drain a bleed on his brain linked to a fall in October. The 79-year-old Lula was in stable condition and speaking and eating normally after the successful operation at Sirio Libanes Hospital, doctors said at a press conference. The bleeding that Lula experienced occurred between his brain and meningeal membrane, said the doctors, who ruled out any injury to the brain or neurological complications. Lula, who was in surgery for about two hours, is expected to remain in intensive care for 48 hours and return to the capital Brasilia early next week “if everything goes well,” his doctor, Roberto Kalil Filho, told reporters. The emergency surgery added to health concerns about the aging president, a standard bearer of the Latin American left who is halfway through his third non-consecutive term. Weak results for his Workers Party in this year’s municipal elections underscored the lack of a clear leftist successor if he chooses not to run for reelection in 2026. Lula has curtailed travel in recent months while doctors monitored his recovery from trauma to the back of his head when he fell at his home in late October, requiring stitches. He complained of a worsening headache during talks with congressional leaders on Monday evening in Brasilia, and was taken to a local hospital for exams, presidential spokesperson Paulo Pimenta said in a radio interview. An MRI scan detected an intracranial hemorrhage, and Lula was flown soon after to Sao Paulo for the surgery, according to a medical note released by the government. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin canceled plans in Sao Paulo on Tuesday to return to Brasilia, his aide said, where he will assume Lula’s agenda, including a visit from Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico. Pimenta said Lula may not need to formally transfer the powers of the presidency to Alckmin. After some five decades of public life, Lula remains a dynamic force on Brazil’s political scene, whipping up crowds with his gruff voice and hammering out policy details in personal meetings with lawmakers. Born into poverty in northeast Brazil, Lula found work as a metalworker in Sao Paulo before rising through union ranks to lead strikes pitting him against the country’s military government in the 1970s. He co-founded the Workers Party and ran repeatedly for the presidency after Brazil’s transition to democracy in the 1980s before winning the office in 2002. His first two terms were marked by a China-driven commodities boom that boosted Brazil’s economy and helped to fund more generous social spending. After he left office in 2011 with record popularity, his chosen successor oversaw a deep recession and was impeached amid a sprawling corruption investigation that jailed Lula himself, convicted of accepting bribes. The Supreme Court eventually threw out that conviction on procedural grounds, opening the door for his successful presidential run in 2022 to cap a stunning comeback. His first year back in office was marked by a series of international trips - and hip surgery in September. In late October he slipped and fell in the presidential residence, leading to the intracranial bleeding that his doctors had been monitoring. The injury forced him to cancel a trip to Russia for a summit of the BRICS group of major emerging markets in Kazan. Tests in early November showed Lula’s condition was stable and he remained active, recently traveling to Montevideo to discuss a Mercosur trade deal. “I wish President Lula a speedy recovery. May he return to work as soon as possible to continue leading his government’s actions, so important for the country at this moment,” Senate head Rodrigo Pacheco said in a statement. Pacheco and the speaker of Brazil’s lower house of Congress, Arthur Lira, met with Lula on Monday as he pushed for legislative approval of a package of spending cuts that has kept financial markets on edge.\n",

            "In an age ruled by neatly slicked buns, it’s easy to forget there was a time before extra-hold gel — when hair was encouraged to expand rather than contract. At the LA premiere for “A Complete Unknown” Tuesday night, Elle Fanning took it upon herself to remind us of those halcyon days, with a bouncy blonde beehive that acted as a portal to the past. Her 1960s-style up-do was finished with a pair of tousled pigtails, secured with two crystal hair-ties which doubled as Fanning’s jewelry for the evening. The actor — who plays Bob Dylan’s girlfriend Sylvie Russo in James Mangold’s upcoming film — arrived onto the red carpet in a custom white Gucci silk gown trimmed with crystal embellishments. Stacked hair has shifted in and out of vogue since the 18th century, when Marie Antoinette popularized “le pouf” — a high mass of hair so heavily decorated and adorned it often required a cushion to keep its shape. In 1960 it was reimagined by Chicago-based stylist Margaret Vinci Heldt, the official mother of the beehive, and quickly became one of the most recognizable hairstyles of the 20th century. The conical pile of locks were inspired by the silhouette of fez and pillbox hats beloved by Jackie Onassis and fixed into place using a mixture of pins and copious hairspray. It was a signature style for Brigitte Bardot, Barbara Streisand, Dolly Parton and, this side of the millennium, by British singer Amy Winehouse. Yet although the retro look has been making a slow and steady return, it’s not to be confused with the hair crowns of yore. Today, height is no longer the primary metric of success for a beehive, as celebrities and brands opt for a more subtle lift. For Versace’s Spring-Summer 2024 runway, models were dressed in swingin’ sixties mini-dresses and given tasteful miniature bouffants. Similarly, at Bora Aksu’s Spring-Summer 2025 shows, models sported twin sets, cats eye sunglasses and towering ‘dos. And while Nicola Coughlan, Zendaya and Kaia Gerber have all embraced the power of hair-teasing this year, the aim for this new style is less Marge Simpson, more muted. While Fanning’s mid-century style is a welcome break from the ballerina buns du jour, it’s still a far cry from the mantra most associated with Dolly Parton: “the higher the hair, the closer to Heaven.”\n",

On Saturday, the palace released the image selected for the festive greetings card, which was taken earlier this year by Millie Pilkington. Pilkington, one of the United Kingdom’s most respected portrait photographers, has taken numerous snaps of the family over the years. The portrait of the happy couple was snapped in April in the garden at Buckingham Palace. It captures King Charles, 76, dressed in a gray suit and blue tie, standing in side profile with his hand in his pocket. Camilla, 77, wearing a blue wool crepe ensemble by luxury couturier Fiona Clare, stands next to him. The message inside the card reads: “Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year.” It’s a more casual option than last year’s photograph taken in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace following the King’scoronation. Senior members of the Windsor clan traditionally release a copy of the seasonal card they send to family, friends and colleagues. Royal-watchers will now be looking forward to seeing this year’s card from the Wales family. The Prince and Princess of Wales have been busy in recent days. Prince William traveled to France on Saturday tojoin world leadersat reopening celebrations forNotre Dame.

            "On Saturday, in the 59th minute of his team’sPremier Leagueclash against Nottingham Forest, time seemed to stand still forAston VillagoalkeeperEmiliano Martínez. As a header from Forest’s Nicolás Domínguez whizzed past him, Martínez leapt backwards, reached out one hand and somehow pushed the ball to the ground to stopped it spinning into the net when it was just centimetres in front of the goal line. It was, as former Wales defender Ashley Williams said on BBC’s Match of the Day, simply “the best save I have ever seen.” “He is so clever, he understands where he is and what he needs to do. He is facing the wrong way,” Williams added. Other pundits and players also hailed Martínez. England goalkeeper Mary Earps called the save “beyond outrageous” on Instagram while the Premier League said it was “world-class.” Former Liverpool defender Jamie Redknapp said on Sky Sports that he couldn’t “think of a better Premier League save in my life.” “It’s almost like a magician, sleight of hand. That is truly sensational,” Redknapp added. Ultimately, however, Martínez’s heroics were in vain as Aston Villa succumbed to a 2-1 loss, undone by a late Forest fightback. Villa had taken the lead three minutes after the Argentinian’s brilliant save through a Jhon Durán header. Unai Emery’s men defended that lead for almost the rest of the game until Nikola Milenković headed the ball into the net in the 87th minute and Martínez fumbled that save. Forest secured the victory five minutes later in injury time when Anthony Elanga prodded the ball in from close range. With that win, Forest climbed to fourth in the Premier League table while Villa remained in sixth place.\n",

            "Over the past three years, Elon Musk has met dozens of times with presidents, prime ministers, lawmakers, government officials and political candidates from around the world. Some of these meetings have been highly publicized, like his visit to Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following criticism over an antisemitic post Musk boosted on X. Other meetings, such as a recent conversation with Argentine President Javier Milei, the world only glimpses through the billionaire’s social media posts. Known topics of conversation ranged from business opportunities for Musk’s companies to elections and policy issues such as trade, energy, education and population management, according to a CNN review of Musk’s meetings, calls and conversations with political figures around the world since August 2021. Although some of his relationships with those leaders go back even further, in that time, Musk has gone from being one of the world’s wealthiest and most influential businessmen to an increasingly powerful player in global affairs. Taken together, the meetings show how Musk has been courted not only for his companies and deep pocketbook but also for his ability to impact the course of wars through hisStarlink satellite service;his opinion onartificial intelligence,the next major wave of technology development; and his role inswaying public opinionthrough his platform, X. On Friday, the Wall Street Journalreportedthat Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian government officials, including about Starlink, since late 2022. CNN has not independently confirmed the conversations, so they are not included in our analysis. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN the report was “absolutely false.” He said Musk and Putin have only ever spoken once, adding that the conversation was over the phone and took place before 2022. Musk’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. For Musk, conversations with world leaders are a virtuous cycle: The six prominent companies he owns or runs give him an in with those figures, whose support often fuels their growth. In turn, those leaders’ interest in attracting Musk’s business provides an opportunity for him to advise on some of his other pet interests, such as global birth rates and immigration. At the same time, the South Africa-born billionaire has become a political power player in his adopted home, the United States. He held livestream campaign events on X for presidential hopefuls Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who both later dropped out of the race, as well as formerPresident Donald Trump.Musk has since thrown his weight — and tens of millions of dollars — behind Trump, attending and hosting rallies on his behalf and criticizing (and, in some cases, spreading false information about) his competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris, on X. “He’s trying to be a global influencer, and I guess he’s decided he needs to do more than use X,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Of course, it’s not unusual for corporate leaders to sometimes meet with government officials, and Musk is not the only big business name to publicly weigh in on the upcoming US presidential election. But the extent of Musk’s public political involvement is unusual for the chief executive of a public company like Tesla — as well as the owner of several powerful private firms, executive leadership experts told CNN. “What’s different about it is that there’s a political aspect, and most CEOs steer clear of politics,” Lewis said. “They’re going to the head of another state, basically, to make the commercial conditions better for their product, maybe to lobby on a certain point, but they don’t usually do politics,” he said, adding that with Musk, “there’s a political tone to everything he does.” At least some of Musk’s political relationships appear to have benefited his companies. In May 2022, Muskmetwith the then-President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, to mark the launch of Starlink in the country, a major new market for the satellite business. In February 2023, he heldcallswith then-Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador about a new Tesla manufacturing plant in the state of Nuevo Leon, for which the company later received $153 million worth of incentives from the state. In May 2023, he held meetings with Chinese government officials shortly after Tesla announced plans for anew battery plantin Shanghai; Musk made asurprise returnto China this April for a visit with Premier Li Qiang, weeks before the company broke ground on the facility. Even more world leaders, includingFrench President Emmanuel Macron,Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoganandIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have met with Musk to ask Tesla to invest in their countries. CNN’s analysis includes only meetings for which at least some information is publicly available. It’s possible the billionaire has calls or meetings with leaders that he does not post about. “One might say he doesn’t have to pay lobbyists, because he’s his own lobbyist, globally,” said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School who focuses on executive leadership. But, he added, “when you’ve got other people’s money at stake, you have to moderate your activities … when you get into these extremes, you can impact your business.” Musk has not hesitated to deal in extremes. He’swarnedof the downfall of America if Democrats are elected, pushed falseconspiracy theorieson topics such as mail-in voting and warned in public events of a “woke mind virus” that threatens society’s advancements. Separately, Musk has also taken heat for boosting anantisemitic conspiracy theory, racist false claims aboutimmigrationand the dangerous‘Pizzagate’conspiracy, as well as posting aHolocaust jokeon X. Recently, Musk’s political activism has begun to have a tangible impact on his companies: Brands pulled their advertisements from X,tanking its value.And SpaceX earlier this monthsued a California regulatorafter it allegedly denied a bid to allow more rocket launches over the billionaire’s controversial comments, claiming it had violated Musk’s freedom of speech. (The agency did not comment on the suit.) CNN’s analysis also suggests that Musk has, in particular, worked to develop influence among a set of right-leaning world leaders, including Modi, Bolsonaro, Milei and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “He’s probably more comfortable with them … these are people who want to meet with him, and not everyone wants to meet with Elon Musk,” Lewis said. “It’s birds of a feather. He likes visiting people who are going to be pleased to be receiving Elon Musk.” During a conference for Italy’s far-right Brothers of Italy party last year, Musk railed against “illegal immigration” and the “woke mind virus” that he said was gripping the US. Musk called it “evil” and warned of it moving to Italy. India’s Modi, who was recentlyreelectedfor a rare third consecutive term, used his plans for electric vehicle manufacturing growth — including conversations with Musk about a potential Tesla factory — as acampaign talking point, although a meeting in India between the two men earlier this year where Musk was expected to announce the facility was rescheduled. Musk has also met with Milei multiple times in his first year leading Argentina, during which time the president hasfaced protestsover a huge spike in poverty rates as a result of austerity measures. “I recommend investing in Argentina,” Musk said in anX postfollowing a May meeting between the pair. In anotherpostlast month, Musk said, “Milei is bringing prosperity to Argentina.” (Argentina is home tohuge stores of lithium, an essential component in batteries like the ones used in Tesla’s cars.) Now, as he campaigns for Trump, Musk may be setting himself up for his most prominent political role yet: a position in a possible future Trump White House. Musk and Trump have publicly discussed having the billionaire lead a new government efficiency commission — which Musk has jokingly referred to as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency — if the former president is reelected. Methodology:CNN’s analysis is based on information compiled from news reports, X posts and press releases. It is possible other meetings exist, or other topics were discussed beyond what is publicly available. The position titles are as of the time of the meeting.\n",

            "The ancient mountains of the Andes are home to spectacled bears, pumas and the magnificent Andean condor. They’re also home to forests of lesser-known but critically important polylepis– known as “cloud trees.” Growing up to 5,000 meters above sea level, they are thehighest-altitude trees in the worldand are known to absorb and retain water from clouds and the Andes’ melting glaciers. Slowly, they release this water through spongy moss that covers the trees, feeding the mountain streams and, eventually, the headwaters of the Amazon River. In the past, polylepis forests covered vast areas of the mountain range, but today, after hundreds of years of deforestation and development, just500,000 hectaresremain, thought to be between1% and 10%of the original forest. As a result, ecosystems have degraded, and the forestsno longer provide a natural barrier to flooding or erosion. The water security of the millions of people who live in the foothills of the Andes is also at risk. Constantino Aucca Chutas, a Peruvian biologist whose grandparents were farmers from the indigenous Quechua community, felt compelled to protect his ancestral lands and the people who live on them. “I’m proud of being an Inca descendant,” he tells CNN. “When I was a child, I grew up near rivers, enjoying seeing the creatures and all this magnificent nature. I thought to myself, it would be fantastic if we can pass this to the new generations.” In 2018, he co-founded Acción Andina, a joint initiative between US nonprofit Global Forest Generation and Peruvian nonprofit Asociación Ecosistemas Andinos, dedicated to restoring the highland forest and protecting the local communities that depend on it. Work began in Peru, but has since spread across Ecuador, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, with the ultimate goal of protecting and restoring one million hectares of native Andean forest by 2045. To date, Aucca Chutas says the initiative has planted more than 10 million trees across the region, with the help of thousands of indigenous families. “The first time we were all united along the Andes was when we were part of one empire, the Inca empire,” he says. “The second time we united again to fight for our independence… This is the third time: united for one tree, the polylepis tree.” The Inca, a civilization that ruled across the Andes mountain range in the 15th and 16th centuries AD, worshiped “Pachamama” or “Mother Earth.” Aucca Chutas says that a deep respect for nature was ingrained in the culture, with animals such as the condor, puma and the snake representing heaven, Earth and the world of the dead. “In the Inca culture, they respect rivers, mountains and the environment,” he says. “They managed the nature, lived in balance with nature. That is the thing that we need to learn and practice.” They also believed in the concept of “Ayni and Minka,” he adds, which represented an idea of working together for the common good. He was determined to revive this principle to help save the highland forests, enlisting the help of local Quechua communities. “My dream was to plant millions of trees and I’m not going to do that alone,” he says. Each year, in the valleys around Cusco, a city in the Peruvian Andes, Acción Andina hosts Queuña Raymi, a tree-growing festival. The celebration begins with ancestral rituals, such as dances and music to honor Pachamama. Then all generations, young and old, male and female, climb the mountain together, dressed in bright traditional clothing and carrying bundles of polylepis saplings on their backs. In previous years, the community has planted as many as 100,000 trees in a single day, using a process of propagation, where root cuttings are planted. Aucca Chutas says that it is important to only plant local species as they have found that polylepis trees vary between regions and altitudes. After planting, the initiative puts up fencing and sets up programs to protect the trees from fire, while the community help to care for and maintain the saplings. The local knowledge is invaluable, says Aucca Chutas: “They have lived in the forest all their lives and have been seeing how these trees are growing, and I think they understand it much better than us.” In return for their efforts, Acción Andina provides communities with support such as arranging medical care and installing solar panels to help bring electricity to villages. It also helps to secure legal rights to their land and establish protected areas for the native forests, safeguarding them against exploitation by timber, mining and oil companies. The initiative has been hailed as a model for community-based conservation worldwide.In 2024, Acción Andina won Prince William’sEarthshot Prizein the “Protect and Restore Nature” category, and in 2022, Aucca Chutas was named a “Champion of the Earth” by the UN. “This community-led restoration is an example of how people and communities can come together for nature, creating jobs and enhancing conservation efforts globally,” Elizabeth Mrema, deputy executive director of the UN Environment Programme, told CNN in an email. “The nature benefits of polylepis forests are immense,” she added. “They prevent soil erosion, capture moisture and retain rainwater with their lichens, mosses and other accompanying plants, playing a major role in water security together with the wetlands.” These magical trees are worth protecting, and to do that, Aucca Chutas believes a collective approach is vital. “It’s the only way conservation is going to be successful,” he says. “Conservation and the protection of Mother Earth is a responsibility for all of us.”\n",

            "The world now knows the colors ofSyriandictator Bashar al-Assad’s parachute: the Russian tricolor. Assad’s flight toMoscowfollowing the swift collapse of his regime means more than just the loss of a client state for the Kremlin. The fall of the House of Assad deals a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aspirations as a Middle East power broker – and raises new questions about the fragility of his own regime. Putin’s opponents are already cheering. “Minus one dictator and ally of Putin,”wrote prominent Russian opposition activist Ilya Yashinon X, posting a photo of an Assad banner in flames. “Putin has thrown Assad under the bus to prolong his war in Ukraine,” commented formerUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. “His resources are scarce, and he is not as strong as he pretends.” For observers ofRussia’s war on Ukraine, Assad’s departureraises some striking historical parallels. Assad now joins a onetime Ukrainian counterpart in exile: Former Ukrainian PresidentViktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine for Russiain 2014 after weeks of street protests that culminated in a bloody crackdown. Syrians are now roaming through Assad’s abandoned presidential palace in Damascus, much as Ukrainians were able to visit the grounds of Mezhyhirya,the garish estate once occupied by Yanukovych. Mezhyhirya was refashioned as a museum of corruption. Yanukovych has not returned to Ukraine since his ouster, even though Russia now effectively controls more than 20% of Ukrainian territory following its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. And unlike Assad, whose forces appeared to surrender Damascus without a fight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held fast asRussian troops approached Kyiv.(Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who also backed by the United States, did waver andAfghanistan fell to the Talibanin 2021.) Assad’s flight from Syria was more than a moment for Ukrainians to revel in a symbolic setback for Putin. The Syrian regime crumbled at the moment when Zelensky was in France to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and US President-elect Donald Trump ahead of the reopening ceremony at Notre Dame Cathedral, where the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation. Ukraine isbracing for the consequences of Trump’s re-election victoryamid fears that the incoming administration could withdraw support for Kyiv. But the implosion of Assad’s regime could potentially weaken Putin’s hand in negotiations over ending the war in Ukraine, particularly if Putin’sbellicose threats in recent weeksof nuclear escalation are perceived as hollow. As rebel fighters closed in on Damascus, Trump himself nodded to the Kremlin’s narrowing range of optionsin a post on social media.“Russia, because they are so tied up in Ukraine, and with the loss there of over 600,000 soldiers, seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years,” he wrote. But the collapse of the Assad regime represents a very real military loss to Putin. In the wake of rebel advances, video emerged showing the toppling of a monument to Assad in Tartus, on Syria’s Mediterranean coast, where Moscow has kept a naval base since the Cold War. Russia has also relied on its airbase at Hmeimim, in Syria’s Latakia province, as a hub for projecting power in the Middle East. In avisit to Hmeimim in 2017, Putin pledged that the two bases would “continue to operation on a permanent basis,” warning that if “the terrorists” – i.e., the opponents of Assad – “raise their heads again, we will deal unprecedented strikes unlike anything they have seen.” When Putin intervened directly in Syria nearly a decade ago, sending his air force and Russian mercenaries to prop up Assad’s losing forces in concert with Iran, his escalation paid dividends: He bought time for Assad, brought more of Syria’s geography under government control, and showed himself as an essential player in regional and global politics. Onceshunned at the G20 summit in 2014after his annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine and his stoking of separatism in Ukraine’s Donbas region, Putin was theman to speak to a year later.By doubling down on Assad, theKremlin leader went from zero to hero, at least in the geopolitical war of perceptions. Putin’s pledges of support for Assad a decade ago now seem empty. But it may still be early to write off Putin as a rival negotiator and potential adversary, despite the ouster of his client. Tatiana Stanovaya, a close observer of Putin,suggested in a poston X that Assad’s defeat may harden Putin’s negotiating position on Ukraine. “Putin may raise additional conditions and will not agree to negotiations readily. He will insist that it is now up to the West and Ukraine to change their stance,” she said, noting Trump’s calls on Putin to end the war in Ukraine. “Note that Assad’s collapse has also shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.” Putin has long seen himself locked in an adversarial conflict with the West, and he faces awarrant from the International Criminal Courtover alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The ouster of Assad may only harden his position.\n",
